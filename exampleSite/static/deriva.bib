Single-cell RNA-seq is a powerful technique. Nevertheless, there are important limitations, including the technical challenges of breaking down an organ or tissue into a single-cell suspension. Invariably, this has required enzymatic incubation at 37°C, which can be expected to result in artifactual changes in gene expression patterns. Here, we describe a dissociation method that uses a protease with high activity in the cold, purified from a psychrophilic microorganism. The entire procedure is carried out at 6°C or colder, at which temperature mammalian transcriptional machinery is largely inactive, thereby effectively ‘freezing in’ the in vivo gene expression patterns. To test this method, we carried out RNA-seq on 20,424 single cells from postnatal day 1 mouse kidneys, comparing the results of the psychrophilic protease method with procedures using 37°C incubation. We show that the cold protease method provides a great reduction in gene expression artifacts. In addition, the results produce a single-cell resolution gene expression atlas of the newborn mouse kidney, an interesting time in development when mature nephrons are present yet nephrogenesis remains extremely active.},

The kidney contains the functional units, the nephrons, surrounded by the renal interstitium. Previously we discovered that, once Six2-expressing nephron progenitor cells and Foxd1-expressing renal interstitial progenitor cells form at the onset of kidney development, descendant cells from these populations contribute exclusively to the main body of nephrons and renal interstitial tissues, respectively, indicating a lineage boundary between the nephron and renal interstitial compartments. Currently it is unclear how lineages are regulated during kidney organogenesis. We demonstrate that nephron progenitor cells lacking Pax2 fail to differentiate into nephron cells but can switch fates into renal interstitium-like cell types. These data suggest that Pax2 function maintains nephron progenitor cells by repressing a renal interstitial cell program. Thus, the lineage boundary between the nephron and renal interstitial compartments is maintained by the Pax2 activity in nephron progenitor cells during kidney organogenesis.},

Branching morphogenesis creates arborized epithelial networks. In the mammalian kidney, an epithelial progenitor pool at ureteric branch tips (UBTs) creates the urine-transporting collecting system. Using region-specific mouse reporter strains, we performed an RNA-seq screen, identifying tip- and stalk-enriched gene sets in the developing collecting duct system. Detailed in situ hybridization studies of tip-enriched predictions identified UBT-enriched gene sets conserved between the mouse and human kidney. Comparative spatial analysis of their UBT niche expression highlighted distinct patterns of gene expression revealing novel molecular heterogeneity within the UBT progenitor population. To identify kidney-specific and shared programs of branching morphogenesis, comparative expression studies on the developing mouse lung were combined with in silico analysis of the developing mouse salivary gland. These studies highlight a shared gene set with multi-organ tip enrichment and a gene set specific to UBTs. This comprehensive analysis extends our current understanding of the ureteric branch tip niche.},

Cellular interactions among nephron, interstitial, and collecting duct progenitors drive mammalian kidney development. In mice, Six2+ nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) and Foxd1+ interstitial progenitor cells (IPCs) form largely distinct lineage compartments at the onset of metanephric kidney development. Here, we used the method for analyzing RNA following intracellular sorting (MARIS) approach, single-cell transcriptional profiling, in situ hybridization, and immunolabeling to characterize the presumptive NPC and IPC compartments of the developing human kidney. As in mice, each progenitor population adopts a stereotypical arrangement in the human nephron-forming niche: NPCs capped outgrowing ureteric branch tips, whereas IPCs were sandwiched between the NPCs and the renal capsule. Unlike mouse NPCs, human NPCs displayed a transcriptional profile that overlapped substantially with the IPC transcriptional profile, and key IPC determinants, including FOXD1, were readily detected within SIX2+ NPCs. Comparative gene expression profiling in human and mouse Six2/SIX2+ NPCs showed broad agreement between the species but also identified species-biased expression of some genes. Notably, some human NPC-enriched genes, including DAPL1 and COL9A2, are linked to human renal disease. We further explored the cellular diversity of mesenchymal cell types in the human nephrogenic niche through single-cell transcriptional profiling. Data analysis stratified NPCs into two main subpopulations and identified a third group of differentiating cells. These findings were confirmed by section in situ hybridization with novel human NPC markers predicted through the single-cell studies. This study provides a benchmark for the mesenchymal progenitors in the human nephrogenic niche and highlights species-variability in kidney developmental programs.},

	abstract = {Nephron progenitor number determines nephron endowment; a reduced nephron count is linked to the onset of kidney disease. Several transcriptional regulators including Six2, Wt1, Osr1, Sall1, Eya1, Pax2, and Hox11 paralogues are required for specification and/or maintenance of nephron progenitors. However, little is known about the regulatory intersection of these players. Here, we have mapped nephron progenitor-specific transcriptional networks of Six2, Hoxd11, Osr1, and Wt1. We identified 373 multi-factor associated ‘regulatory hotspots’ around genes closely associated with progenitor programs. To examine their functional significance, we deleted ‘hotspot’ enhancer elements for Six2 and Wnt4. Removal of the distal enhancer for Six2 leads to a {\textasciitilde}40\% reduction in Six2 expression. When combined with a Six2 null allele, progeny display a premature depletion of nephron progenitors. Loss of the Wnt4 enhancer led to a significant reduction of Wnt4 expression in renal vesicles and a mildly hypoplastic kidney, a phenotype also enhanced in combination with a Wnt4 null mutation. To explore the regulatory landscape that supports proper target gene expression, we performed CTCF ChIP-seq to identify insulator-boundary regions. One such putative boundary lies between the Six2 and Six3 loci. Evidence for the functional significance of this boundary was obtained by deep sequencing of the radiation-induced Brachyrrhine (Br) mutant allele. We identified an inversion of the Six2/Six3 locus around the CTCF-bound boundary, removing Six2 from its distal enhancer regulation, but placed next to Six3 enhancer elements which support ectopic Six2 expression in the lens where Six3 is normally expressed. Six3 is now predicted to fall under control of the Six2 distal enhancer. Consistent with this view, we observed ectopic Six3 in nephron progenitors. 4C-seq supports the model for Six2 distal enhancer interactions in wild-type and Br/+ mouse kidneys. Together, these data expand our view of the regulatory genome and regulatory landscape underpinning mammalian nephrogenesis.},

In the mouse, directional looping of the heart and rotation of the embryo, the first overt evidence of left/right asymmetry (L/R), are observed at early somite stages ( approximately E8.5) [1, 2]. Activation of a Nodal-Pitx2 regulatory pathway specifically within the left lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) is critical for these events [3-10]. Asymmetric expression of Nodal is thought to be triggered by left-oriented, cilia-generated flow within the ventral, midline node [11, 12]. Genetic removal of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in the mouse demonstrates a requirement for Hedgehog signals in the symmetry-breaking process [13], and analysis of node trafficking has suggested a mechanism of directional transport in the node that might relate to symmetry breaking in the LPM [14]. Here we provide evidence that Hedgehog signaling in the node is not essential for breaking bilateral symmetry. In contrast, direct Hh signaling in the LPM is critical. Evidence is presented that Sonic and Indian hedgehog signals act together, through a Foxf1/Bmp4 pathway, to enable the initiation and propagation of Nodal signaling within the LPM, regulating the competence of that tissue to respond to the Nodal pathway.},

	abstract = {Kidney development involves complex morphogenetic interactions, some of which are not currently well defined. The morphologic development of the nephron, in specific, is a well described process that is part of a robust literature on renal developmental morphogenesis. It is an aim of the field to elucidate mechanisms controlling the morphogenesis of the developing kidney. To achieve an understanding of renal morphogenetic programs a wealth of microarray data has been collected describing temporal and spatial aspects of the developing kidney in vivo. This data is augmented with microarray data from in vitro systems that recapitulate aspects of renal development. This data has largely been examined in isolation, and to begin addressing renal development from an integrative perspective we collect diverse spatial and temporal microarray data sets and together with the in vitro models begin an integrated analysis. The aim is to provide insight into morphogenetic programs controlling renal development and provide a model for analysis of any complex process for which disparate data exists. The “crossing” of in vivo developmental data by multiple methods provides contextualization to the data sets. Integration of in vivo spatial data with in vitro model microarray data highlighted novel cytokine and growth factor mediated pathways involved in late development of the collecting system and nephron. To specifically analyze the morphogenetic processes controlling renal tubulogenesis in spinal cord-induced metanephric mesenchyme, the model was analyzed from transcriptomic, anatomic, and biochemical perspectives to arrive at a characterization of in vitro nephrogenesis permissive of perturbation. Analysis of multiple nephrogenesis data sets identified regulatory mechanisms in a series of temporal networks. A screen of putative tubulogenesis regulating signaling pathways identified in transcriptomic analyses was performed. PKA activity was found to regulate morphogenesis of the renal vesicle, with sustained activity of the enzyme preventing tubular morphogenesis. Microarray analysis confirmed PKA activity prevented progression of development from the renal vesicle stage of morphogenesis. The Wnt signaling pathway was implicated and confirmed to upregulated by PKA signaling. Inhibition of the Wnt pathway rescued the PKA mediated disruption of tubulogenesis. This systems level analysis highlights novel early and late mechanisms of renal tubular morphogenesis.},

Despite considerable temporal and spatial data on gene expression in mammalian kidney development, primarily in rodent species, there is a paucity of genes whose expression is absolutely specific to a given anatomical compartment and/or developmental stage, defined here as 'anchor' genes. We previously generated an atlas of gene expression in the developing mouse kidney using microarray analysis of anatomical compartments collected via laser capture microdissection. Here, this data is further analysed to identify anchor genes via stringent bioinformatic filtering followed by high resolution section in situ hybridisation performed on 200 transcripts selected as specific to one of 11 anatomical compartments within the midgestation mouse kidney. A total of 37 anchor genes were identified across 6 compartments with the early proximal tubule being the compartment richest in anchor genes. Analysis of minimal and evolutionarily conserved promoter regions of this set of 25 anchor genes identified enrichment of transcription factor binding sites for Hnf4a and Hnf1b, RbpJ (Notch signalling), PPARγ:RxRA and COUP-TF family transcription factors. This was reinforced by GO analyses which also identified these anchor genes as targets in processes including epithelial proliferation and proximal tubular function. As well as defining anchor genes, this large scale validation of gene expression identified a further 92 compartment-enriched genes able to subcompartmentalise key processes during murine renal organogenesis spatially or ontologically. This included a cohort of 13 ureteric epithelial genes revealing previously unappreciated compartmentalisation of the collecting duct system and a series of early tubule genes suggesting that segmentation into proximal tubule, loop of Henle and distal tubule does not occur until the onset of glomerular vascularisation. Overall, this study serves to illuminate previously ill-defined stages of patterning and will enable further refinement of the lineage relationships within mammalian kidney development.},

METHODS: The baboon kidney transcriptome was characterized at 60-day gestation (DG), 90 DG, 125 DG, 140 DG, 160 DG and adulthood (6-12 years) using gene arrays and validated by QRT-PCR. Pathway and cluster analyses were used to characterize gene expression in the context of biological pathways.
RESULTS: Pathway analysis indicated activation of pathways not previously reported as relevant to kidney development. Cluster analysis also revealed gene splice variants with discordant expression profiles during development.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first detailed genetic analysis of the developing primate kidney, and our findings of discordant expression of gene splice variants suggest that gene arrays likely provide a simplified view and demonstrate the need to study the fetal renal proteome.},

	abstract = {The vertebrate kidney is comprised of functional units known as nephrons. Defects in nephron development or activity are a common feature of kidney disease. Current medical treatments are unable to ameliorate the dire consequences of nephron deficit or injury. Although there have been tremendous advancements in our understanding of nephron ontogeny and the response to damage, many significant knowledge gaps still remain. The zebrafish embryo kidney, or pronephros, is an ideal model for many renal development and regeneration studies because it is comprised of nephrons that share conserved features with the nephron units that comprise the mammalian metanephric kidney. In this chapter, we provide an overview about the benefits of using the zebrafish pronephros to study the mechanisms underlying nephrogen- esis as well as epithelial repair and regeneration. We subsequently detail methods for the spatiotemporal assessment of gene and protein expression in zebrafish embryos that can be used to extend the understanding of nephron development and disease, and thereby create new opportunities to identify therapeutic strategies for regenerative medicine.},

However, the NPC WNT-receptor complex is unknown. We obtained M15 cells from E10.5 mesonephric mesenchyme and systematically analyzed components required for canonical WNT9b-responsiveness. When M15 cells were transfected with a β-catenin luciferase reporter plasmid, exposure to recombinant WNT9b resulted in minimal luciferase activity. We then analyzed mRNA-expression of WNT-pathway components and identified Fzd1-6 and Lrp6 transcripts but not Rspo1. When M15 cells were treated with recombinant RSPO1 the response to transfected WNT9b was augmented 4.8-fold. Co-transfection of M15 cells with Fzd5 (but no other Fzd family member) further increased the WNT9b signal to 16.8-fold and siRNA knockdown of Fzd5 reduced the signal by 52\%. Knockdown of Lrp6 resulted in 60\% WNT9b signal reduction. We confirmed Fzd5, Lrp6 and Rspo1 mRNA expression in CITED1(+) NPCs from E15.5 embryonic mouse kidney. Thus, while many WNT signaling-pathway components are present by E10.5, optimum responsiveness of E11.5 cap mesenchyme requires that NPCs acquire RSPO1, FZD5 and LRP6.},

	abstract = {Despite mounting evidence that p53 senses and responds to physiological cues in vivo, existing knowledge regarding p53 function and target genes is largely derived from studies in cancer or stressed cells. Herein we utilize p53 transcriptome and ChIP-Seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation-high throughput sequencing) analyses to identify p53 regulated pathways in the embryonic kidney, an organ that develops via mesenchymal-epithelial interactions. This integrated approach allowed identification of novel genes that are possible direct p53 targets during kidney development. We find the p53-regulated transcriptome in the embryonic kidney is largely composed of genes regulating developmental, morphogenesis, and metabolic pathways. Surprisingly, genes in cell cycle and apoptosis pathways account for {\textless}5\% of differentially expressed transcripts. Of 7,893 p53-occupied genomic regions (peaks), the vast majority contain consensus p53 binding sites. Interestingly, 78\% of p53 peaks in the developing kidney lie within proximal promoters of annotated genes compared with 7\% in a representative cancer cell line; 25\% of the differentially expressed p53-bound genes are present in nephron progenitors and nascent nephrons, including key transcriptional regulators, components of Fgf, Wnt, Bmp, and Notch pathways, and ciliogenesis genes. The results indicate widespread p53 binding to the genome in vivo and context-dependent differences in the p53 regulon between cancer, stress, and development. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of the p53 transcriptome and cistrome in a developing mammalian organ, substantiating the role of p53 as a bona fide developmental regulator. We conclude p53 targets transcriptional networks regulating nephrogenesis and cellular metabolism during kidney development.},

The development of molecular medicine allows us to generate comprehensive profiles of information at genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic levels to define podocyte function and failure. Integrating data from two or more of these approaches improves functional annotations and facilitates the formulation of biological hypotheses. We will review the definition of systems biology, the integration between large-scale datasets, the current status of the systems biology approach in podocyte research, as well as the challenges and opportunities in the field.

We isolated CD24+ cells from E15 kidneys of mice with the canonical WNT signaling reporter. 40\% of cells responded to WNT3a in vitro and when infused into glycerol-injured adult, the cells exhibited β-catenin/TCF reporter activity when integrated into damaged tubules. When embryonic CD24+ cells were treated with a β-catenin/TCF pathway inhibitor (IWR-1) prior to infusion into glycerol-injured mice, tubular integration of cells was sharply reduced. Thus, the endogenous canonical β-catenin/TCF pathway is reactivated during recovery from AKI and is required for integration of exogenous embryonic renal progenitor cells into damaged tubules.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: About 3\%-5\% of adults with membranous nephropathy have autoantibodies directed against thrombospondin type 1 domain-containing 7A (THSD7A), a podocyte-expressed transmembrane protein. However, the temporal and spatial expression of THSD7A and its biologic function for podocytes are unknown, information that is needed to understand the effects of THSD7A autoantibodies in this disease.
METHODS: Using a variety of microscopic techniques, we analyzed THSD7A localization in postnatal, adult, and autoantibody-injected mice as well as in human podocytes. We also analyzed THSD7A function in human podocytes using confocal microscopy; Western blotting; and adhesion and migration assays.
RESULTS: We found that THSD7A expression begins on glomerular vascularization with slit diaphragm formation in development. THSD7A localizes to the basal aspect of foot processes, closely following the meanders of the slit diaphragm in human and mice. Autoantibodies binding to THSD7A localize to the slit diaphragm. In human podocytes, THSD7A expression is accentuated at filopodia and thin arborized protrusions, an expression pattern associated with decreased membrane activity of cytoskeletal regulators. We also found that, phenotypically, THSD7A expression in human podocytes is associated not only with increases in cell size, enhanced adhesion, and reduced detachment from collagen type IV-coated plates but also, with decreased ability to migrate.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that THSD7A functions as a foot process protein involved in the stabilization of the slit diaphragm of mature podocytes and that autoantibodies to THSD7A, on the basis of their localization, might structurally and functionally alter the slit diaphragm's permeability to protein.},

However, little is known about the roles of lncRNAs in kidney development. In our present study, we aimed to identify functional lncRNAs in one of the three lineages of kidney progenitor cells, i.e., metanephric mesenchymal (MM) cells. We conducted comprehensive analyses of the chromatin signature and transcriptome by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. We found seventeen lncRNAs that were expressed specifically in MM cells with an active chromatin signature, while remaining silenced in a bivalent chromatin state in non-MM cells. Out of these MM specific lncRNAs, we identified a lncRNA, Gm29418, in a distal enhancer region of Six2, a key regulatory gene of MM cells. We further identified three transcript variants of Gm29418 by Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE), and confirmed that the transcription-start-sites (TSSs) of these variants were consistent with the result of Cap Analysis Gene Expression (CAGE). In support of the enhancer-like function of Gm29418 on Six2 expression, we found that knock-down of Gm29418 by two independent anti-sense locked nucleic acid (LNA) phosphorothioate gapmers suppressed Six2 mRNA expression levels in MM cells. We also found that over-expression of Gm29418 led to an increase in Six2 mRNA expression levels in a mouse MM cell line. In conclusion, we identified a lncRNA, Gm29418, in nephron progenitor cells that has an enhancer-like function on a key regulatory gene, Six2.},

	abstract = {Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the retrograde passage of urine from the bladder to the upper urinary tract. It is the most common congenital urological anomaly affecting 1-2\% of children and 30-40\% of patients with urinary tract infections. VUR is a major risk factor for pyelonephritic scarring and chronic renal failure in children. It is the result of a shortened intravesical ureter with an enlarged or malpositioned ureteric orifice. An ectopic embryonal ureteric budding development is implicated in the pathogenesis of VUR, which is a complex genetic developmental disorder. Many genes are involved in the ureteric budding formation and subsequently in the urinary tract and kidney development. Previous studies demonstrate an heterogeneous genetic pattern of VUR. In fact no single major locus or gene for primary VUR has been identified. It is likely that different forms of VUR with different genetic determinantes are present. Moreover genetic studies of syndromes with associated VUR have revealed several possible candidate genes involved in the pathogenesis of VUR and related urinary tract malformations. Mutations in genes essential for urinary tract morphogenesis are linked to numerous congenital syndromes, and in most of those VUR is a feature. The Authors provide an overview of the developmental processes leading to the VUR. The different genes and signaling pathways controlling the embryonal urinary tract development are analyzed. A better understanding of VUR genetic bases could improve the management of this condition in children.},

	abstract = {Cell subtype proportion variability between samples contributes significantly to the variation of functional genomic properties such as gene expression or DNA methylation. Although the impact of the variation of cell subtype composition on measured genomic quantities is recognized, and some innovative tools have been developed for the analysis of heterogeneous samples, most functional genomics studies using samples with mixed cell types still ignore the influence of cell subtype proportion variation, or just deal with it as a nuisance variable to be eliminated. Here we demonstrate how harvesting information about cell subtype proportions from functional genomics data can provide insights into cellular changes associated with phenotypes. We focused on two types of mixed cell populations, human blood and mouse kidney. Cell type prediction is well developed in the former, but not currently in the latter. Estimating the cellular repertoire is easier when a reference dataset from purified samples of all cell types in the tissue is available, as is the case for blood. However, reference datasets are not available for most other tissues, such as the kidney. In this study, we showed that the proportion of alterations attributable to changes in the cellular composition varies strikingly in the two disorders (asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus), suggesting that the contribution of cell subtype proportion changes to functional genomic properties can be disease-specific. We also showed that a reference dataset from a single-cell RNA-seq study successfully estimated the cell subtype proportions in mouse kidney and allowed us to distinguish altered cell subtype differences between two different knock-out mouse models, both of which had reported a reduced number of glomeruli compared to their wild-type counterparts. These findings demonstrate that testing for changes in cell subtype proportions between conditions can yield important insights in functional genomics studies.},

Clinically, decreased congenital nephron endowment because of renal hypodysplasia is associated with an increased risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease, and this is at least partly dependent on the self-renewal of nephron progenitors. Here, we present evidence for a novel molecular mechanism regulating the self-renewal of nephron progenitors and congenital nephron endowment by the highly conserved miR-17{\textasciitilde}92 cluster. Whole transcriptome sequencing revealed that nephron progenitors lacking this cluster demonstrated increased Cftr expression. We showed that one member of the cluster, miR-19b, is sufficient to repress Cftr expression in vitro and that perturbation of Cftr activity in nephron progenitors results in impaired proliferation. Together, these data suggest that miR-19b regulates Cftr expression in nephron progenitors, with this interaction playing a role in appropriate nephron progenitor self-renewal during kidney development to generate normal nephron endowment.},

Here, we sought to develop a more efficient approach for direct reprogramming of human cells that could be applied in vivo. PiggyBac transposons are a non-viral integrating gene delivery system that is suitable for in vivo use and allows for simultaneous delivery of multiple genes. Using an inducible piggyBac transposon system, we optimized a protocol for the direct reprogramming of HK2 cells to induced nephron progenitor-like cells with expression of only 3 transcription factors (SNAI2, EYA1, and SIX1). Culture in conditions supportive of the nephron progenitor state further increased the expression of nephron progenitor genes. The refined protocol was then applied to primary human renal epithelial cells, which integrated into developing nephron structures in vitro and in vivo. Such inducible reprogramming to nephron progenitor-like cells could facilitate direct cellular reprogramming for kidney regeneration.},

I describe an approach to communicating these ontologies that involves (1) identifying content patterns within an ontology, (2) creating a simplified tutorial to explain basic concepts within the ontology, (3) involving potential users in the design of an ontology browser interface, and (4) creating graphics to support the process of building and communicating the ontology. This approach should be applicable to any spatially-oriented ontology, and should result in visualizations that will enhance understanding of ontologies.},

	abstract = {During development, nephron progenitor cells (NPC) are induced to differentiate by WNT9b signals from the ureteric bud. Although nephrogenesis ends in the perinatal period, acute kidney injury (AKI) elicits repopulation of damaged nephrons. Interestingly, embryonic NPC infused into adult mice with AKI are incorporated into regenerating tubules. Since WNT/β-catenin signaling is crucial for primary nephrogenesis, we reasoned that it might also be needed for the endogenous repair mechanism and for integration of exogenous NPC. When we examined glycerol-induced AKI in adult mice bearing a β-catenin/TCF reporter transgene, endogenous tubular cells reexpressed the NPC marker, CD24, and showed widespread β-catenin/TCF signaling. We isolated CD24+ cells from E15 kidneys of mice with the canonical WNT signaling reporter. 40\% of cells responded to WNT3a in vitro and when infused into glycerol-injured adult, the cells exhibited β-catenin/TCF reporter activity when integrated into damaged tubules. When embryonic CD24+ cells were treated with a β-catenin/TCF pathway inhibitor (IWR-1) prior to infusion into glycerol-injured mice, tubular integration of cells was sharply reduced. Thus, the endogenous canonical β-catenin/TCF pathway is reactivated during recovery from AKI and is required for integration of exogenous embryonic renal progenitor cells into damaged tubules. These events appear to recapitulate the WNT-dependent inductive process which drives primary nephrogenesis.},

Primary VUR is familial, with transmission rate and sibling risk both approaching 50\%, and appears highly genetically heterogeneous. It is often associated with other developmental anomalies of the urinary tract, emphasising its etiology as a disorder of urogenital tract development. We conducted a genome-wide linkage and association study in three European populations to search for loci predisposing to VUR. Family-based association analysis of 1098 parent-affected-child trios and case/control association analysis of 1147 cases and 3789 controls did not reveal any compelling associations, but parametric linkage analysis of 460 families (1062 affected individuals) under a dominant model identified a single region, on 10q26, that showed strong linkage (HLOD = 4.90; ZLRLOD = 4.39) to VUR. The {\textasciitilde}9Mb region contains 69 genes, including some good biological candidates. Resequencing this region in selected individuals did not clearly implicate any gene but FOXI2, FANK1 and GLRX3 remain candidates for further investigation.

Altered DNA methylation plays an important role in the onset and progression of kidney disease. However, little is known about how the changes arise in disease states. Here, we report that KAT5-mediated DNA damage repair is essential for the maintenance of kidney podocytes and is associated with DNA methylation status. Podocyte-specific KAT5-knockout mice develop severe albuminuria with increased DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), increased DNA methylation of the nephrin promoter region, and decreased nephrin expression. Podocyte KAT5 expression is decreased, whereas DNA DSBs and DNA methylation are increased in diabetic nephropathy; moreover, KAT5 restoration by gene transfer attenuates albuminuria. Furthermore, KAT5 decreases DNA DSBs and DNA methylation at the same nephrin promoter region, which indicates that KAT5-mediated DNA repair may be related to DNA methylation status. These results suggest a concept in which an environment of DNA damage repair, which occurs with decreased KAT5, may affect DNA methylation status.},

	abstract = {Wilms tumour (WT) is an embryonal tumour that recapitulates kidney development. The normal kidney is formed from two distinct embryological origins: the metanephric mesenchyme (MM) and the ureteric bud (UB). It is generally accepted that WT arises from precursor cells in the MM; however whether UB-equivalent structures participate in tumorigenesis is uncertain. To address the question of the involvement of UB, we assessed 55 Wilms tumours for the molecular features of MM and UB using gene expression profiling, immunohistochemsitry and immunofluorescence. Expression profiling primarily based on the Genitourinary Molecular Anatomy Project data identified molecular signatures of the UB and collecting duct as well as those of the proximal and distal tubules in the triphasic histology group. We performed immunolabeling for fetal kidneys and WTs. We focused on a central epithelial blastema pattern which is the characteristic of triphasic histology characterized by UB-like epithelial structures surrounded by MM and MM-derived epithelial structures, evoking the induction/aggregation phase of the developing kidney. The UB-like epithelial structures and surrounding MM and epithelial structures resembling early glomerular epithelium, proximal and distal tubules showed similar expression patterns to those of the developing kidney. These observations indicate WTs can arise from a precursor cell capable of generating the entire kidney, such as the cells of the intermediate mesoderm from which both the MM and UB are derived. Moreover, this provides an explanation for the variable histological features of mesenchymal to epithelial differentiation seen in WT.},

	abstract = {SOX family proteins SOX2 and SOX18 have been reported as being essential in determining hair follicle type; however, the role they play during development remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Sox18 regulates the normal differentiation of the dermal papilla of all hair types. In guard (primary) hair dermal condensate (DC) cells, we identified transient Sox18 in addition to SOX2 expression at E14.5, which allowed fate tracing of primary DC cells until birth. Similarly, expression of Sox18 was detected in the DC cells of secondary hairs at E16.5 and in tertiary hair at E18.5. Dominant-negative Sox18 mutation (opposum) did not prevent DC formation in any hair type. However, it affected dermal papilla differentiation, restricting hair formation especially in secondary and tertiary hairs. This Sox18 mutation also prevented neonatal dermal cells or dermal papilla spheres from inducing hair in regeneration assays. Microarray expression studies identified WNT5A and TNC as potential downstream effectors of SOX18 that are important for epidermal WNT signalling. In conclusion, SOX18 acts as a mesenchymal molecular switch necessary for the formation and function of the dermal papilla in all hair types.},

We have used immunofluorescence and time-lapse calcium imaging of cultured explanted embryonic rat kidneys to study the role of calcium signaling for branching morphogenesis. In mesenchymal cells, we recorded spontaneous calcium activity that was characterized by irregular calcium transients. The calcium signals were dependent on release of calcium from intracellular stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. Down-regulation of the calcium activity, both by blocking the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and by chelating cytosolic calcium, resulted in retardation of branching morphogenesis and a reduced formation of primitive nephrons but had no effect on cell proliferation. We propose that spontaneous calcium activity contributes with a stochastic factor to the self-organizing process that controls branching morphogenesis, a major determinant of the ultimate number of nephrons in the kidney.-Fontana, J.

We found that tfap2a acts downstream of Iroquois homeobox 3b (irx3b), a distal lineage transcription factor, to operate a circuit consisting of tfap2b, irx1a and genes encoding solute transporters that dictate the specialized metabolic functions of distal nephron segments. Interestingly, this regulatory node is distinct from other checkpoints of differentiation, such as polarity establishment and ciliogenesis. Thus, our studies reveal insights into the genetic control of differentiation, where tfap2a is essential for regulating a suite of segment transporter traits at the final tier of zebrafish pronephros ontogeny.

In the mouse, MGA is necessary for the survival of the pluripotent epiblast cells of the peri-implantation embryo and a null, gene-trap allele MgaGt results in embryonic lethality shortly after implantation. We have used this allele to document expression of Mga in postimplantation embryos and also investigated a second, hypomorphic gene-trap allele, MgaInv.
RESULTS: Compound heterozygotes, MgaGt/MgaInv, die prior to midgestation. The extraembryonic portion of the embryos appears to develop relatively normally while the embryonic portion, including the pluripotent cells of the epiblast, is severely retarded by E7.5. Mga expression is initially limited to the pluripotent inner cell mass of the blastocyst and epiblast, but during organogenesis it is widely expressed, notably in the central nervous system and sensory organs, reproductive and excretory systems, heart, somites and limbs.
CONCLUSIONS: Widespread yet specific areas of expression of Mga during organogenesis raise the possibility that the transcription factor may play roles in controlling proliferation and potency in the progenitor cell populations of different organ systems. Documentation of these patterns sets the stage for the investigation of specific progenitor cell types.},

Studies using the megabladder (mgb -/- ) model of CKD show that renal urothelium plays a key role in modulating early injury responses following the development of congenital obstruction. The aim of this review is to examine the role that urothelium has in normal urinary tract development and pathogenesis. We discuss normal morphology of renal urothelium and then examine the role that uroplakins (Upks) play in its development. Histologic, biochemical, and molecular characterization of Upk1b RFP/RFP mice indicated Upk1b expression is essential for normal urinary tract development, apical plaque/asymmetric membrane unit (AUM) formation, and differentiation and functional integrity of the renal urothelium. Our studies provide the first evidence that Upk1b is directly associated with the development of congenital anomalies of the urinary tract (CAKUT), spontaneous age-dependent hydronephrosis, and dysplastic urothelia. These observations demonstrate the importance of proper urothelial differentiation in normal development and pathogenesis of the urinary tract and provide a unique working model to test the hypothesis that the complex etiology associated with CKD is dependent upon predetermined genetic susceptibilities that establish pathogenic thresholds for disease initiation and progression.},

TMEM16A confers calcium-activated chloride channel activity, which is of importance for various cellular functions in secretory epithelia and involved in secretion-dependent renal cyst growth. However, its specific function in renal physiology has remained elusive so far. Therefore, we generated conditional nephron-specific TMEM16A-knockout mice and found that these animals suffered from albuminuria. Kidney histology demonstrated an intact corticomedullary differentiation and absence of cysts. Electron microscopy showed a normal slit diaphragm. However, the total number of glomeruli and total nephron count was decreased in TMEM16A-knockout animals. At the same time, glomerular diameter was increased, presumably as a result of the hyperfiltration in the remaining glomeruli. TUNEL and PCNA stainings showed increased cell death and increased proliferation. Proximal tubular cilia were intact in young animals, but the number of properly ciliated cells was decreased in older, albuminuric animals. Taken together, our data suggest that TMEM16A may be involved in ureteric bud branching and proper nephron endowment. Loss of TMEM16A resulted in reduced nephron number and, subsequently, albuminuria and tubular damage.},

Embryonic kidney re-aggregation in vitro assays have been established which allow for the monitoring of organotypic cell behaviour in re-aggregated and chimeric renal organoids. However, evaluation of cell integration is hampered by the high photonic load of standard fluorescence microscopy which poses challenges for imaging three-dimensional systems in real-time over a time course. Therefore, we employed light sheet microscopy, a technique that vastly reduces photobleaching and phototoxic effects. We have also developed a new method for culturing the re-aggregates which involves immersed culture, generating organoids which more closely reflect development in vivo. To facilitate imaging from various angles, we embedded the organoids in a freely rotatable hydrogel cylinder. Endpoint fixing and staining were performed to provide additional biomolecular information. We succeeded in imaging labelled cells within re-aggregated kidney organoids over 15 hours and tracking their fate while simultaneously monitoring the development of organotypic morphological structures. Our results show that Wt1-expressing embryonic kidney cells obtained from transgenic mice could integrate into re-aggregated chimeric kidney organoids and contribute to developing nephrons. Furthermore, the nascent proximal tubules that formed in the re-aggregated tissues using the new culture method displayed secretory function, as evidenced by their ability to secrete an organic anion mimic into the tubular lumen.},

Therefore, we studied the contribution of Par1a/b to renal epithelial development. We examined the renal phenotype of newborn compound mutant mice carrying only one allele of Par1a or Par1b. Loss of three out of four Par1a/b alleles resulted in severe renal hypoplasia, associated with impaired ureteric bud branching. Compared with kidneys of newborn control littermates, kidneys of newborn mutant mice exhibited dilated proximal tubules and immature glomeruli, and the renal proximal tubular epithelia lacked proper localization of adhesion complexes. Furthermore, Par1a/b mutants expressed low levels of renal Notch ligand Jag1, activated Notch2, and Notch effecter Hes1. Together, these data demonstrate that Par1a/b has a key role in glomerular and proximal tubule development, likely via modulation of Notch signaling.},

A large number of online atlases and databases have been developed to mange the rapidly growing amount of data describing embryogenesis. As these community resources continue to evolve, it is important to understand how representations of anatomy can facilitate the sharing and integration of data. In addition, attention to the design of the interfaces is critical to make online resources useful and usable.

Results
I first present a survey of online atlases and gene expression resources for model organisms, with a focus on methods of semantic and spatial representation of anatomy. A total of 14 anatomical atlases and 21 gene expression resources are included. This survey demonstrates how choices in semantic representation, in the form of ontologies, can enhance interface search functions and provide links between relevant information. This survey also reviews methods for spatially representing anatomy in online resources. I then provide a collection of patterns for interface design based on the atlases and databases surveyed. These patterns include methods for displaying graphics, integrating semantic and spatial representations, organizing information, and querying databases to find genes expressed in anatomical structures.

Conclusions
This collection of patterns for interface design will assist biologists and software developers in planning the interfaces of new atlases and databases or enhancing existing ones. They also show the benefits of standardizing semantic and spatial representations of anatomy by demonstrating how interfaces can use standardization to provide enhanced functionality.},

An important part of the renal filtration barrier is composed of podocytes with their actin-rich foot processes. In this study, we used stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to mass spectrometry to characterize relative changes in the phosphoproteome of human podocytes in response to short-term treatment with AngII. In 4 replicates, we identified a total of 17,956 peptides that were traceable to 2081 distinct proteins. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that among the increasingly phosphorylated peptides are predominantly peptides that are related to actin filaments, cytoskeleton, lamellipodia, mammalian target of rapamycin, and MAPK signaling. Among others, this screening approach highlighted the increased phosphorylation of actin-bundling protein, l-plastin (LCP1). AngII-dependent phosphorylation of LCP1 in cultured podocytes was mediated by the kinases ERK, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase, PKA, or PKC. LCP1 phosphorylation increased filopodia formation. In addition, treatment with AngII led to LCP1 redistribution to the cell margins, membrane ruffling, and formation of lamellipodia.

A total of 34 cases (30 males and 4 females) with PBS identified from all live births in New York State (1998-2005) were genotyped using Illumina HumanOmni2.5 microarrays. CNVs were prioritized if they were absent from in-house controls, encompassed ≥10 consecutive probes, were ≥20 Kb in size, had ≤20\% overlap with common variants in population reference controls, and had ≤20\% overlap with any variant previously detected in other birth defect phenotypes screened in our laboratory. We identified 17 candidate autosomal CNVs; 10 cases each had one CNV and four cases each had two CNVs. The CNVs included a 158 Kb duplication at 4q22 that overlaps the BMPR1B gene; duplications of different sizes carried by two cases in the intron of STIM1 gene; a 67 Kb duplication 202 Kb downstream of the NOG gene, and a 1.34 Mb deletion including the MYOCD gene. The identified rare CNVs spanned genes involved in mesodermal, muscle, and urinary tract development and differentiation, which might help in elucidating the genetic contribution to PBS. We did not have parental DNA and cannot identify whether these CNVs were de novo or inherited. Further research on these CNVs, particularly BMP signaling is warranted to elucidate the pathogenesis of PBS.},

In a candidate gene approach, we analyzed the SOX17 gene in hypomyelinating leukodystrophies (HL) characterized by a permanent deficit in the amount of central nervous system myelin. Five genes are involved in the aetiology of HL but 40\% of HL remains without known genetic origin (UHL). New sequence variations in SOX17 were identified but all correspond to nonpathogenic variants, suggesting that SOX17 is not involved in UHL phenotype. In one patient, we identified the c.775T{\textgreater}A (p.Tyr259Asn) variation already reported as causative of congenital kidney and urinary tract abnormalities (CAKUT). Nevertheless, since our patient did not present such a phenotype, we propose that this variant may alternatively represent an "at-risk" allele for CAKUT rather than a causative allele. This observation strengthens the idea that caution must be taken when linking genetic variation to disease, especially in discrete phenotypes such as CAKUT.},

In the current study, we provide further validation of these predicted effects using a congenic mouse line carrying the entire CAST/EiJ (CAST)-derived Mpkd1-3 interval on the C57BL/6J background. We have also generated a derivative congenic line with a refined CAST-derived Mpkd1-2 interval and demonstrated its dominantly-acting disease-modulating effects (e.g., 4.2-fold increase in total cyst area; p{\textless}0.001). The relative strength of these effects allowed the use of recombinants from these crosses to fine map the Mpkd2 effects to a {\textless}14 Mbp interval that contains 92 RefSeq sequences. One of them corresponds to the previously described positional Mpkd2 candidate gene, Kif12. Among the positional Mpkd2 candidates, only expression of Kif12 correlates strongly with the expression pattern of Cys1 across multiple anatomical nephron structures and developmental time points. Also, we demonstrate that Kif12 encodes a primary cilium-associated protein. Together, these data provide genetic and informatic validation of the predicted renal cystic disease-modulating effects of Mpkd1-3 loci and implicate Kif12 as the candidate locus for Mpkd2.},

	abstract = {Vertebrate kidneys contain nephron functional units where specialized epithelial cell types are organized into segments with discrete physiological roles. Many gaps remain in our understanding of how segment regions develop. Here, we report that the transcription factor empty spiracles homeobox gene 1 (emx1) is a novel nephron segment regulator during embryonic kidney development in zebrafish. emx1 loss of function altered the domains of distal segments without changes in cell turnover or traits like size and morphology, indicating that emx1 directs distal segment fates during nephrogenesis. In exploring how emx1 influences nephron patterning, we found that retinoic acid (RA), a morphogen that induces proximal and represses distal segments, negatively regulates emx1 expression. Next, through a series of genetic studies, we found that emx1 acts downstream of a cascade involving mecom and tbx2b, which encode essential distal segment transcription factors. Finally, we determined that emx1 regulates the expression domains of irx3b and irx1a to control distal segmentation, and sim1a to control corpuscle of Stannius formation. Taken together, our work reveals for the first time that emx1 is a key component of the pronephros segmentation network, which has implications for understanding the genetic regulatory cascades that orchestrate vertebrate nephron patterning.},

The mice and the bacterial artificial chromosome transgenes are available from repositories (MMRRC or CHORI), thereby making these resources readily available to the research community. This resource of 1,386 transgenic lines was developed and validated for neuroscience research. However, GENSAT mice have many potential applications in other contexts including studies of development outside of the CNS. The cell type-specific expression of fluorescent proteins in these mice has been used to identify cells in living embryos, in living embryo explants, and in stem or progenitor cell populations in postnatal tissues. The large number of fluorescent protein driver lines generated by GENSAT greatly expands the range of cell type markers that can be used for live cell sorting. In addition, the GENSAT project has generated 278 new Cre driver lines. This review provides an overview of the GENSAT lines and information for identifying lines that may be useful for a particular application.

In this report, we describe an additional patient carrying a de novo missense variant in EBF3 (c.487C{\textgreater}T, p.(Arg163Trp)) that falls within a conserved residue in the zinc knuckle motif of the DNA binding domain. Without a solved structure of the DNA binding domain, we generated a homology-based atomic model and performed molecular dynamics simulations for EBF3, which predicted decreased DNA affinity for p.(Arg163Trp) compared with wild-type protein and control variants. These data are in agreement with previous experimental studies of EBF1 showing the paralogous residue is essential for DNA binding. The conservation and experimental evidence existing for EBF1 and in silico modeling and dynamics simulations to validate comparable behavior of multiple variants in EBF3 demonstrates strong support for the pathogenicity of p.(Arg163Trp). We show that our patient presents with phenotypes consistent with previously reported patients harboring EBF3 variants and expands the phenotypic spectrum of this newly identified disorder with the additional feature of a bicornuate uterus.},

	abstract = {Constitutive expression of Krüppel-like factor 3 (KLF3, BKLF) increases marginal zone (MZ) B cell numbers, a phenotype shared with mice lacking KLF2. Ablation of KLF3, known to interact with serum response factor (SRF), or SRF itself, results in fewer MZ B cells. It is unknown how these functional equivalences result. In this study, it is shown that KLF3 acts as transcriptional repressor for the leukocyte-specific integrin β7 (Itgb7, Ly69) by binding to the β7 promoter, as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. KLF2 overexpression antagonizes this repression and also binds the β7 promoter, indicating that these factors may compete for target sequence(s). Whereas β7 is identified as direct KLF target, its repression by KLF3 is not connected to the MZ B cell increase because β7-deficient mice have a normal complement of these and the KLF3-driven increase still occurs when β7 is deleted. Despite this, KLF3 overexpression abolishes lymphocyte homing to Peyer's patches, much like β7 deficiency does. Furthermore, KLF3 expression alone overcomes the MZ B cell deficiency when SRF is absent. SRF is also dispensable for the KLF3-mediated repression of β7. Thus, despite the shared phenotype of KLF3 and SRF-deficient mice, cooperation of these factors appears neither relevant for the formation of MZ B cells nor for the regulation of β7. Finally, a potent negative regulatory feedback loop limiting KLF3 expression is shown in this study, mediated by KLF3 directly repressing its own gene promoter. In summary, KLFs use regulatory circuits to steer lymphocyte maturation and homing and directly control leukocyte integrin expression.},

As such, kidney development has been the subject of intensive study, using a variety of techniques, including in situ hybridization, organ culture and gene targeting, revealing many critical genes and pathways. Nevertheless, proper organogenesis requires precise patterns of cell type specific differential gene expression, involving very large numbers of genes. This review is focused on the use of global profiling technologies to create an atlas of gene expression codes driving development of different mammalian kidney compartments. Such an atlas allows one to select a gene of interest, and to determine its expression level in each element of the developing kidney, or to select a structure of interest, such as the renal vesicle, and to examine its complete gene expression state. Novel component specific molecular markers are identified, and the changing waves of gene expression that drive nephrogenesis are defined. As the tools continue to improve for the purification of specific cell types and expression profiling of even individual cells it is possible to predict an atlas of gene expression during kidney development that extends to single cell resolution.},

Here, we performed marker analysis, cell proliferation assays, and genetic lineage tracing to define the lineage relations and restrictions of the mesenchymal and epithelial cell types in the developing and mature mouse ureter. At embryonic day (E) 12.5, the mesenchymal precursor pool began to subdivide into an inner and outer compartment that began to express markers of smooth muscle precursors and adventitial fibrocytes, respectively, by E13.5. Smooth muscle precursors further diversified into lamina propria cells directly adjacent to the ureteric epithelium and differentiated smooth muscle cells from E16.5 onwards. Uncommitted epithelial progenitors of the ureter differentiated into intermediate cells at E14.5. After stratification into two layers at E15.5 and three cell layers at E18.5, intermediate cells differentiated into basal cells and superficial cells. In homeostasis, proliferation of all epithelial and mesenchymal cell types remained low but intermediate cells still gave rise to basal cells, whereas basal cells divided only into basal cells.

	abstract = {Kidneys remove unwanted substances from the body and regulate the internal body environment. These functions are carried out by specialized cells (podocytes) that act as a filtration barrier between the internal milieu and the outside world, and by a series of tubules and ducts that process the filtrate and convey it to the outside. In the kidneys of amniote vertebrates, the filtration (podocyte) and tubular functions are tightly integrated into functional units called nephrons. The specification of the podocyte and tubular components of amniote nephrons is currently not well understood. The present study investigates podocyte and tubule differentiation in the avian mesonephric kidney, and presents several findings that refine our understanding of the initial events of nephron formation. First, well before the first morphological or molecular signs of nephron formation, mesonephric mesenchyme can be separated on the basis of morphology and the expression of the transcription factor Pod1 into dorsal and ventral components, which can independently differentiate in culture along tubule and podocyte pathways, respectively. Second, canonical Wnt signals, which are found in the nephric duct adjacent to the dorsal mesonephric mesenchyme and later in portions of the differentiating nephron, strongly inhibit podocyte but not tubule differentiation, suggesting that Wnt signaling plays an important role in the segmentation of the mesonephric mesenchyme into tubular and glomerular segments. The results are discussed in terms of their broader implications for models of nephron segmentation.},

The assumption that most murine embryonic lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are venous derived has recently been challenged. Here, we show that the embryonic dermal blood capillary plexus constitutes an additional, local source of LECs that contributes to the formation of the dermal lymphatic vascular network. We describe a novel mechanism whereby rare PROX1-positive endothelial cells exit the capillary plexus in a Ccbe1-dependent manner to establish discrete LEC clusters. As development proceeds, these clusters expand and further contribute to the growing lymphatic system. Lineage tracing and analyses of Gata2-deficient mice confirmed that these clusters are endothelial in origin. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Vegfc in the vasculature increased the number of PROX1-positive progenitors within the capillary bed. Our work reveals a novel source of lymphatic endothelial progenitors employed during construction of the dermal lymphatic vasculature and demonstrates that the blood vasculature is likely to remain an ongoing source of LECs during organogenesis, raising the question of whether a similar mechanism operates during pathological lymphangiogenesis.},

	abstract = {Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) occur in 1 in 500 births and are a major cause of morbidity in children. Notably, CAKUT account for the most cases of pediatric end-stage renal disease and predispose the individual to hypertension and cardiovascular disease throughout life. Although some forms of CAKUT are a part of a syndrome or are associated with a positive family history, most cases of renal system anomalies are sporadic and isolated to the urinary tract. Broad phenotypic spectrum of CAKUT and variability in genotype-phenotype correlation indicate that pathogenesis of CAKUT is a complex process that depends on interplay of many factors. This review focuses on the genetic mechanisms (single-gene mutations, modifier genes) leading to renal system anomalies in humans and discusses emerging insights into the role of epigenetics, in utero environmental factors, and micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of CAKUT. Common gene networks that function in defined temporospatial fashion to orchestrate renal system morphogenesis are highlighted. Derangements in cellular, molecular, and morphogenetic mechanisms that direct normal renal system development are emphasized as a major cause of CAKUT. Integrated understanding of how morphogenetic process disruptions are linked to CAKUT will enable improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of congenital renal system anomalies and their consequences.},

These precursor cells arise from the proliferative ovarian surface epithelium and enter mitotic arrest prior to upregulating Foxl2. Granulosa cells that populate the cortical primordial follicles activated in adult life derive from the surface epithelium perinatally, and enter mitotic arrest at that stage. Ingression from the surface epithelium dropped to undetectable levels by Postnatal Day 7, when most surviving oocytes were individually encapsulated by granulosa cells.

The function of kidney pericytes as microvascular cells and how these cells detach from peritubular capillaries and migrate to the interstitial space, however, are poorly understood. Here, we used an unbiased approach to identify genes in kidney pericytes relevant to detachment and differentiation in response to injury in vivo, with a particular focus on genes regulating proteolytic activity and angiogenesis. Kidney pericytes rapidly activated expression of a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs-1 (ADAMTS1) and downregulated its inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) in response to injury. Similarly to brain pericytes, kidney pericytes bound to and stabilized capillary tube networks in three-dimensional gels and inhibited metalloproteolytic activity and angiogenic signaling in endothelial cells. In contrast, myofibroblasts did not have these vascular stabilizing functions despite their derivation from kidney pericytes. Pericyte-derived TIMP3 stabilized and ADAMTS1 destabilized the capillary tubular networks. Furthermore, mice deficient in Timp3 had a spontaneous microvascular phenotype in the kidney resulting from overactivated pericytes and were more susceptible to injury-stimulated microvascular rarefaction with an exuberant fibrotic response. Taken together, these data support functions for kidney pericytes in microvascular stability, highlight central roles for regulators of extracellular proteolytic activity in capillary homoeostasis, and identify ADAMTS1 as a marker of activation of kidney pericytes.},

However, our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying nephron development is at an early stage. In order to identify factors involved in nephrogenesis, we performed a high-resolution, spatial profiling of a number of transcriptional regulators expressed within the cap mesenchyme and early developing nephron. Our results demonstrate novel, stereotypic, spatially defined cellular sub-domains within the cap mesenchyme, which may, in part, reflect induction of nephron precursors.

ECM influence in disease, development, healing and regeneration has been demonstrated in many other fields of study, but a thorough examination of the roles of ECM in bladder cell activity has not yet been undertaken. Structural ECM proteins, in concert with adhesive proteins, provide crucial structural support to the bladder. Both structural and nonstructural components of the bladder have major effects on smooth muscle function, through effects on matrix rigidity and signaling through ECM receptors. While many ECM components and receptors identified in the bladder have specific known functions in the vascular smooth musculature, their function in the bladder is often less well defined. In cancer and obstructive disease, the ECM has a critical role in pathogenesis. The challenge in these settings will be to find therapies that prevent hyperproliferation and encourage proper differentiation, through an understanding of matrix effects on cell biology and susceptibility to therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Nephron number in the mammalian kidney is known to vary dramatically, with postnatal renal function directly influenced by nephron complement. What determines final nephron number is poorly understood but nephron formation in the mouse kidney ceases within the first few days after birth, presumably due to the loss of all remaining nephron progenitors via epithelial differentiation. What initiates this event is not known. Indeed, whether nephron formation occurs in the same way at this time as during embryonic development has also not been examined. In this study, we investigate the key cellular compartments involved in nephron formation; the ureteric tip, cap mesenchyme and early nephrons; from postnatal day (P) 0 to 6 in the mouse. High resolution analyses of gene and protein expression indicate that loss of nephron progenitors precedes loss of ureteric tip identity, but show spatial shifts in the expression of cap mesenchyme genes during this time. In addition, cap mesenchymal volume and rate of proliferation decline prior to birth. Section-based 3D modeling and Optical Projection Tomography revealed a burst of ectopic nephron induction, with the formation of multiple (up to 5) nephrons per ureteric tip evident from P2. While the distal-proximal patterning of these nephrons occurred normally, their spatial relationship with the ureteric compartment was altered. We propose that this phase of nephron formation represents an acceleration of differentiation within the cap mesenchyme due to a displacement of signals within the nephrogenic niche.},

	abstract = {The development of the human kidney is a complex process that requires interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal cells, eventually leading to the coordinated growth and differentiation of multiple highly specialized stromal, vascular, and epithelial cell types. The application of molecular biology and immunocytochemistry to the study of cell types involved in renal morphogenesis is leading to a better understanding of nephrogenesis, which requires a fine balance of many factors that can be disturbed by various prenatal events in humans. The aim of this paper is to review human kidney organogenesis, with particular emphasis on the sequence of morphological events, on the immunohistochemical peculiarities of nephron progenitor populations and on the molecular pathways regulating the process of mesenchymal to epithelial transition. Kidney development can be subdivided into five steps: (i) the primary ureteric bud (UB); (ii) the cap mesenchyme; (iii) the mesenchymal-epithelial transition; (iv) glomerulogenesis and tubulogenesis; (v) the interstitial cells. Complex correlations between morphological and molecular events from the origin of the UB and its branching to the metanephric mesenchyme, ending with the maturation of nephrons, have been reported in different animals, including mammals. Marked differences, observed among different species in the origin and the duration of nephrogenesis, suggest that morphological and molecular events may be different in different animal species and mammals. Further studies must be carried out in humans to verify at the morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular levels if the outcome in humans parallels that previously described in other species.},

	abstract = {Cell-lineage-specific transcripts are essential for differentiated tissue function, implicated in hereditary organ failure, and mediate acquired chronic diseases. However, experimental identification of cell-lineage-specific genes in a genome-scale manner is infeasible for most solid human tissues. We developed the first genome-scale method to identify genes with cell-lineage-specific expression, even in lineages not separable by experimental microdissection. Our machine-learning-based approach leverages high-throughput data from tissue homogenates in a novel iterative statistical framework. We applied this method to chronic kidney disease and identified transcripts specific to podocytes, key cells in the glomerular filter responsible for hereditary and most acquired glomerular kidney disease. In a systematic evaluation of our predictions by immunohistochemistry, our in silico approach was significantly more accurate (65\% accuracy in human) than predictions based on direct measurement of in vivo fluorescence-tagged murine podocytes (23\%). Our method identified genes implicated as causal in hereditary glomerular disease and involved in molecular pathways of acquired and chronic renal diseases. Furthermore, based on expression analysis of human kidney disease biopsies, we demonstrated that expression of the podocyte genes identified by our approach is significantly related to the degree of renal impairment in patients.

CAKUT can also lead to significant renal problems in adulthood and may present itself with hypertension and/or proteinuria. Congenital renal anomalies can be sporadic or familial, syndromic (also affecting nonrenal or non-urinary tract tissues), or nonsyndromic.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS) is a common disease that links testicular germ cell cancer, cryptorchidism and some cases of hypospadias and male infertility with impaired development of the testis. The incidence of these disorders has increased over the last few decades, and testicular cancer now affects 1\% of the Danish and Norwegian male population.
METHODS: To identify genetic variants that span the four TDS phenotypes, the authors performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using Affymetrix Human SNP Array 6.0 to screen 488 patients with symptoms of TDS and 439 selected controls with excellent reproductive health. Furthermore, they developed a novel integrative method that combines GWAS data with other TDS-relevant data types and identified additional TDS markers. The most significant findings were replicated in an independent cohort of 671 Nordic men.
RESULTS: Markers located in the region of TGFBR3 and BMP7 showed association with all TDS phenotypes in both the discovery and replication cohorts. An immunohistochemistry investigation confirmed the presence of transforming growth factor β receptor type III (TGFBR3) in peritubular and Leydig cells, in both fetal and adult testis. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the KITLG gene showed significant associations, but only with testicular cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the TGFBR3 and BMP7 genes, which belong to the transforming growth factor β signalling pathway, suggests a role for this pathway in the pathogenesis of TDS. Integrating data from multiple layers can highlight findings in GWAS that are biologically relevant despite having border significance at currently accepted statistical levels.},

Foxd1 is required during kidney development and its inactivation results in failure of nephron progenitor cell differentiation. Foxd1 is expressed in interstitial cells adjacent to nephron progenitor cells, suggesting an essential role for the progenitor cell niche in nephrogenesis. To better understand how cortical interstitial cells in general, and FOXD1 in particular, influence the progenitor cell niche, we examined the differentiation states of two progenitor cell subtypes in Foxd1(-/-) tissue. We found that although nephron progenitor cells are retained in a primitive CITED1-expressing compartment, cortical interstitial cells prematurely differentiate. To identify pathways regulated by FOXD1, we screened for target genes by comparison of Foxd1 null and wild-type tissues. We found that the gene encoding the small leucine-rich proteoglycan decorin (DCN) is repressed by FOXD1 in cortical interstitial cells, and we show that compound genetic inactivation of Dcn partially rescues the failure of progenitor cell differentiation in the Foxd1 null. We demonstrate that DCN antagonizes BMP/SMAD signaling, which is required for the transition of CITED1-expressing nephron progenitor cells to a state that is primed for WNT-induced epithelial differentiation. On the basis of these studies, we propose a mechanism for progenitor cell retention in the Foxd1 null in which misexpressed DCN produced by prematurely differentiated interstitial cells accumulates in the extracellular matrix, inhibiting BMP7-mediated transition of nephron progenitor cells to a compartment in which they can respond to epithelial induction signals.},

Initially, two domains of nephron progenitors are established, then are subdivided and demarcate individual nephron segments. Using genetic and chemical genetic models of retinoic acid (RA) deficiency, we discovered that RA modulates rostral progenitor formation. To delineate downstream pathways, we knocked down the irx3b transcription factor and found it regulates proximal tubule segment size and distal segment differentiation. Our results suggest a model whereby RA patterns the early field of nephron progenitors, with subsequent factors like irx3b acting to refine later progenitor subdomains and ensure activation of segment-specific gene programs.},

Despite the fundamental role of crossing-over in the pairing and segregation of chromosomes during human meiosis, the rates and placements of events vary markedly among individuals. Characterizing this variation and identifying its determinants are essential steps in our understanding of the human recombination process and its evolution.

Study Design/Results
Using three large sets of European-American pedigrees, we examined variation in five recombination phenotypes that capture distinct aspects of crossing-over patterns. We found that the mean recombination rate in males and females and the historical hotspot usage are significantly heritable and are uncorrelated with one another. We then conducted a genome-wide association study in order to identify loci that influence them. We replicated associations of RNF212 with the mean rate in males and in females as well as the association of Inversion 17q21.31 with the female mean rate. We also replicated the association of PRDM9 with historical hotspot usage, finding that it explains most of the genetic variance in this phenotype. In addition, we identified a set of new candidate regions for further validation.

Significance
These findings suggest that variation at broad and fine scales is largely separable and that, beyond three known loci, there is no evidence for common variation with large effects on recombination phenotypes.},

We performed single cell RNA-seq analysis of total mouse kidneys at E11.5 and E12.5, as well as the renal vesicles at P4. We define an early stage of progenitor cell induction driven primarily by gene repression. Surprising stochastic expression of marker genes associated with differentiated cell types was observed in E11.5 progenitors. We provide a global view of the polarized gene expression already present in the renal vesicle, the first epithelial precursor of the nephron. We show that Hox gene read-through transcripts can be spliced to produce intergenic homeobox swaps. We also identify a surprising number of genes with partially degraded noncoding RNA. Perhaps most interesting, at early developmental times single cells often expressed genes related to several developmental pathways. This provides powerful evidence that initial organogenesis involves a process of multilineage priming. This is followed by a combination of gene repression, which turns off the genes associated with most possible lineages, and the activation of increasing numbers of genes driving the chosen developmental direction.},

	abstract = {Recent studies indicate that nephron progenitor cells of the embryonic kidney are arranged in a series of compartments of an increasing state of differentiation. The earliest progenitor compartment, distinguished by expression of CITED1, possesses greater capacity for renewal and differentiation than later compartments. Signaling events governing progression of nephron progenitor cells through stages of increasing differentiation are poorly understood, and their elucidation will provide key insights into normal and dysregulated nephrogenesis, as well as into regenerative processes that follow kidney injury. In this study, we found that the mouse CITED1(+) progenitor compartment is maintained in response to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) ligands that activate both FGF and EGF receptors. This RTK signaling function is dependent on RAS and PI3K signaling but not ERK. In vivo, RAS inactivation by expression of sprouty 1 (Spry1) in CITED1(+) nephron progenitors results in loss of characteristic molecular marker expression and in increased death of progenitor cells. Lineage tracing shows that surviving Spry1-expressing progenitor cells are impaired in their subsequent epithelial differentiation, infrequently contributing to epithelial structures. These findings demonstrate that the survival and developmental potential of cells in the earliest embryonic nephron progenitor cell compartment are dependent on FGF/EGF signaling through RAS.},

	abstract = {Nephron morphogenesis is a complex process that generates blood-filtration units (glomeruli) connected to extremely long and patterned tubular structures. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1β (HNF1β) is a divergent homeobox transcription factor that is expressed in kidney from the first steps of nephrogenesis. Mutations in HNF1B (OMIM \#137920) are frequently found in patients with developmental renal pathologies, the mechanisms of which have not been completely elucidated. Here we show that inactivation of Hnf1b in the murine metanephric mesenchyme leads to a drastic tubular defect characterized by the absence of proximal, distal and Henle's loop segments. Nephrons were eventually characterized by glomeruli, with a dilated urinary space, directly connected to collecting ducts via a primitive and short tubule. In the absence of HNF1β early nephron precursors gave rise to deformed S-shaped bodies characterized by the absence of the typical bulge of epithelial cells at the bend between the mid and lower segments. The lack of this bulge eventually led to the absence of proximal tubules and Henle's loops. The expression of several genes, including Irx1, Osr2 and Pou3f3, was downregulated in the S-shaped bodies. We also observed decreased expression of Dll1 and the consequent defective activation of Notch in the prospective tubular compartment of comma- and S-shaped bodies. Our results reveal a novel hierarchical relationship between HNF1β and key genes involved in renal development. In addition, these studies define a novel structural and functional component of S-shaped bodies at the origin of tubule formation.},

This commentary reflects on the presentations and roundtable discussions from the meeting that were designed to review the state of the art in the field and the practical applications of the new science and to provide focus to the field.
OBJECTIVES: The meeting considered two topics: the emerging data streams amenable to computational modeling and data mining, and the emerging data analysis and modeling tools.
DISCUSSION: Computational toxicology is a subdiscipline of toxicology that aims to use the mathematical, statistical, modeling, and computer science tools to better understand the mechanisms through which a given chemical induces harm and, ultimately, to be able to predict adverse effects of the toxicants on human health and/or the environment. The participants stressed the importance of computational toxicology to the future of environmental health sciences and regulatory decisions in public health; however, many challenges remain to be addressed before the findings from high-throughput screens and in silico models may be considered sufficiently robust and informative.
CONCLUSIONS: Many scientists, regulators, and the general public believe that new and better ways to assess human toxicity are now needed, and technological breakthroughs are empowering the field of toxicity assessment. Even though the application of computational toxicology to environmental health decisions requires additional efforts, the merger of the power of computers with biological information is poised to deliver new tools and knowledge.},

Here, we have demonstrated that in addition to regulating the onset of this transition, HEB and E2A also play a separate role in CD4(+) lineage choice. Deletion of HEB and E2A in DP thymocytes specifically blocked the development of CD4(+) lineage T cells. Furthermore, deletion of the E protein inhibitors Id2 and Id3 allowed CD4(+) T cell development but blocked CD8(+) lineage development. Analysis of the CD4(+) lineage transcriptional regulators ThPOK and Gata3 placed HEB and E2A upstream of CD4(+) lineage specification. These studies identify an important role for E proteins in the activation of CD4(+) lineage differentiation as thymocytes undergo the DP to SP transition.},

	abstract = {Approximately 50\% of patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) develop metastatic disease, which is almost invariably lethal. However, our understanding of pathways that drive aggressive behavior of MIBC is incomplete. Members of the FOXA subfamily of transcription factors are implicated in normal urogenital development and urologic malignancies. FOXA proteins are implicated in normal urothelial differentiation, but their role in bladder cancer is unknown. We examined FOXA expression in commonly used in vitro models of bladder cancer and in human bladder cancer specimens, and used a novel in vivo tissue recombination system to determine the functional significance of FOXA1 expression in bladder cancer. Logistic regression analysis showed decreased FOXA1 expression is associated with increasing tumor stage (p{\textless}0.001), and loss of FOXA1 is associated with high histologic grade (p{\textless}0.001). Also, we found that bladder urothelium that has undergone keratinizing squamous metaplasia, a precursor to the development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) exhibited loss of FOXA1 expression. Furthermore, 81\% of cases of SCC of the bladder were negative for FOXA1 staining compared to only 40\% of urothelial cell carcinomas. In addition, we showed that a subpopulation of FOXA1 negative urothelial tumor cells are highly proliferative. Knockdown of FOXA1 in RT4 bladder cancer cells resulted in increased expression of UPK1B, UPK2, UPK3A, and UPK3B, decreased E-cadherin expression and significantly increased cell proliferation, while overexpression of FOXA1 in T24 cells increased E-cadherin expression and significantly decreased cell growth and invasion. In vivo recombination of bladder cancer cells engineered to exhibit reduced FOXA1 expression with embryonic rat bladder mesenchyme and subsequent renal capsule engraftment resulted in enhanced tumor proliferation. These findings provide the first evidence linking loss of FOXA1 expression with histological subtypes of MIBC and urothelial cell proliferation, and suggest an important role for FOXA1 in the malignant phenotype of MIBC.},

Although these cells  of renin lineage (CoRL) decrease in number with advancing kidney age, accompanied by less responsiveness to typical stimuli such as ACE-inhibition, mechanisms and  the impact of sex as a biological variable with age are not known. Accordingly, labeled CoRL were sorted from individual young (2m) and aged (27m) male and female Ren1cCre{\textbar}ZsGreen reporter mice, and their transcriptomic profiles analyzed by RNA seq. When both aged female and male mice were combined, there were 48 differentially expressed genes (DEG) compared to young mice. However, when compared to their young sex-matched mice, aged female and male mice had 159 and 503 DEGs respectively. In addition to marked differences in individual genes between aged female and male mice, gene ontology analysis showed major pathway differences by sex. The majority of DEGs in one sex did not significantly change  or changed in the opposite direction in the other sex. These results show that in CoRL of advanced age, individual genes and gene ontologies change, but differ between female and male mice, highlighting sex related differences the aging process.},

Single-cell profiling revealed shifts in nephron patterning and proportions of component cells. Distinct induced pluripotent stem cell clones showed congruent transcriptional programs, with interexperimental and interclonal variation also strongly associated with nephron patterning. Epithelial cells isolated from organoids aligned with total organoids at the same day of differentiation, again implicating relative maturation as a confounder.

We performed single cell RNA-seq analysis of total mouse kidneys at E11.5 and E12.5, as well as the renal vesicles at P4. We define an early stage of progenitor cell induction driven primarily by gene repression. Surprising stochastic expression of marker genes associated with differentiated cell types was observed in E11.5 progenitors. We provide a global view of the polarized gene expression already present in the renal vesicle, the first epithelial precursor of the nephron. We show that Hox gene read-through transcripts can be spliced to  produce intergenic homeobox swaps. We also identify a surprising number of genes  with partially degraded noncoding RNA. Perhaps most interesting, at early developmental times single cells often expressed genes related to several developmental pathways. This provides powerful evidence that initial organogenesis involves a process of multilineage priming. This is followed by a combination of gene repression, which turns off the genes associated with most possible lineages, and the activation of increasing numbers of genes driving the  chosen developmental direction.},

Total lack of Gdnf, Gfra1 or Ret in mice results in perinatal  lethality due to bilateral renal agenesis or aplasia. In humans, RET mutations have been identified in a spectrum of congenital malformations involving the RET  axis including isolated HSCR, isolated congenital anomalies of kidney or urinary  tract (CAKUT), or CAKUT and HSCR together. The molecular basis for these pleiotropic effects of RET has just begun to be unraveled. In an effort to delineate the pathogenetic mechanisms that underlie these congenital malformations, we and others have characterized Ret's role in early kidney and urinary system development.

Approximately half of unmyelinated nociceptors express the NGF receptor TrkA, and half express the GDNF family ligand (GFL) receptor Ret. The function of NGF/TrkA signaling in the TrkA population of nociceptors has been extensively studied, and NGF/TrkA signaling is a well established mediator of pain. The GFLs are analgesic in models of neuropathic pain emphasizing the importance of understanding the physiological function of GFL/Ret signaling in nociceptors. However, perinatal lethality of Ret-null mice has precluded the study of the physiological role of GFL/Ret signaling in the survival, maintenance, and function of nociceptors in viable mice. We deleted Ret exclusively in nociceptors by crossing nociceptor-specific Na(v)1.8 Cre and Ret conditional mice to produce Ret-Na(v)1.8 conditional knock-out (CKO) mice. Loss of Ret exclusively in nociceptors results in a reduction in nociceptor number and size, indicating that Ret signaling is important for the survival and trophic support of these cells. Ret-Na(v)1.8 CKO mice exhibit reduced epidermal innervation but normal central projections. In addition, Ret-Na(v)1.8 CKO mice have increased sensitivity to cold and increased formalin-induced pain, demonstrating that Ret signaling modulates the function of nociceptors in vivo. Enhanced inflammation-induced pain may be mediated by decreased prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), as PAP levels are markedly reduced in Ret-Na(v)1.8 CKO mice. The results of this study identify the physiological role of endogenous Ret signaling in the survival and function of nociceptors.},

Despite considerable temporal and spatial data on gene expression in mammalian kidney development, primarily in rodent species, there is a paucity of genes whose expression is absolutely specific to a given anatomical compartment and/or  developmental stage, defined here as 'anchor' genes. We previously generated an atlas of gene expression in the developing mouse kidney using microarray analysis of anatomical compartments collected via laser capture microdissection. Here, this data is further analysed to identify anchor genes via stringent bioinformatic filtering followed by high resolution section in situ hybridisation performed on 200 transcripts selected as specific to one of 11 anatomical compartments within the midgestation mouse kidney. A total of 37 anchor genes were identified across 6 compartments with the early proximal tubule being the compartment richest in anchor genes. Analysis of minimal and evolutionarily conserved promoter regions of this set of 25 anchor genes identified enrichment of transcription factor binding sites for Hnf4a and Hnf1b, RbpJ (Notch signalling), PPARgamma:RxRA and COUP-TF family transcription factors. This was reinforced by GO analyses which also identified these anchor genes as targets in  processes including epithelial proliferation and proximal tubular function. As well as defining anchor genes, this large scale validation of gene expression identified a further 92 compartment-enriched genes able to subcompartmentalise key processes during murine renal organogenesis spatially or ontologically. This  included a cohort of 13 ureteric epithelial genes revealing previously unappreciated compartmentalisation of the collecting duct system and a series of  early tubule genes suggesting that segmentation into proximal tubule, loop of Henle and distal tubule does not occur until the onset of glomerular vascularisation. Overall, this study serves to illuminate previously ill-defined  stages of patterning and will enable further refinement of the lineage relationships within mammalian kidney development.},

	abstract = {Mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase RET are associated with congenital anomalies of kidneys or urinary tract (CAKUT). RET tyrosine Y1015 is the docking  site for PLCgamma, a major regulator of RET signaling. Abrogating signaling via Y1015 causes CAKUT that are markedly different than renal agenesis in Ret-null or RetY1062F mutant mice. We performed analysis of Y1015F mutant upper and lower urinary tracts in mice to delineate its molecular and developmental roles during  early urinary tract formation. We found that the degeneration of the common nephric ducts (CND), the caudal-most Wolffian duct (WD) segment, depends on Y1015 signals. The CNDs in Y1015F mutants persist owing to increased proliferation and  reduced apoptosis, and showed abundance of phospho-ERK-positive cells. In the upper urinary tract, the Y1015 signals are required for proper patterning of the  mesonephros and metanephros. Timely regression of mesonephric mesenchyme and proper demarcation of mesonephric and metanephric mesenchyme from the WD depends  on RetY1015 signaling. We show that the mechanism of de novo ectopic budding is via increased ERK activity due to abnormal mesenchymal GDNF expression. Although  reduction in GDNF dosage improved CAKUT it did not affect delayed mesenchyme regression. Experiments using whole-mount immunofluorescence confocal microscopy  and explants cultures of early embryos with ERK-specific inhibitors suggest an imbalance between increased proliferation, decreased apoptosis and increased ERK  activity as a mechanism for WD defects in RetY1015F mice. Our work demonstrates novel inhibitory roles of RetY1015 and provides a possible mechanistic explanation for some of the confounding broad range phenotypes in individuals with CAKUT.},

Considerable effort has gone toward identification of diagnostic biomarkers and analysis of AKI-associated molecular  events; however, most studies have adopted organ-wide approaches and have not elucidated the interplay among different cell types involved in AKI pathophysiology. To better characterize AKI-associated molecular and cellular events, we developed a mouse line that enables the identification of translational profiles in specific cell types. This strategy relies on CRE recombinase-dependent activation of an EGFP-tagged L10a ribosomal protein subunit, which allows translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) of mRNA populations in CRE-expressing cells. Combining this mouse line with cell type-specific CRE-driver lines, we identified distinct cellular responses in an ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) model of AKI. Twenty-four hours following IRI,  distinct translational signatures were identified in the nephron, kidney interstitial cell populations, vascular endothelium, and macrophages/monocytes. Furthermore, TRAP captured known IRI-associated markers, validating this approach. Biological function annotation, canonical pathway analysis, and in situ analysis of identified response genes provided insight into cell-specific injury  signatures. Our study provides a deep, cell-based view of early injury-associated molecular events in AKI and documents a versatile, genetic tool to monitor cell-specific and temporal-specific biological processes in disease modeling.},

Development of new biomarkers and therapies for CKD will be aided by a detailed analysis of myofibroblast gene expression during the early stages of fibrosis.

We therefore adapted translational ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) to isolate and profile mRNA from myofibroblasts and their precursors during kidney fibrosis. We generated and characterized a transgenic mouse expressing an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-tagged L10a ribosomal subunit protein under control of the collagen1alpha1 promoter. We developed a one-step procedure for isolation of polysomal RNA from collagen1alpha1-eGFPL10a mice subject to unilateral ureteral obstruction and analyzed and validated the resulting transcriptional profiles. Pathway analysis revealed strong gene signatures for cell proliferation, migration, and shape change. Numerous novel genes and candidate biomarkers were upregulated during fibrosis, specifically in  myofibroblasts, and we validated these results by quantitative PCR, in situ, and  Western blot analysis.

	abstract = {Beta-catenin (CTNNB1) directs ectodermal appendage spacing by activating ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR) transcription, but whether CTNNB1 acts by a similar mechanism in the prostate, an endoderm-derived tissue, is unclear. Here we examined the expression, function, and CTNNB1 dependence of the EDAR pathway during prostate development. In situ hybridization studies reveal EDAR pathway components including Wnt10b in the developing prostate and localize these factors to prostatic bud epithelium where CTNNB1 target genes are co-expressed. We used a genetic approach to ectopically activate CTNNB1 in developing mouse prostate and observed focal increases in Edar and Wnt10b mRNAs. We also used a genetic approach to test the prostatic consequences of activating or inhibiting Edar expression. Edar overexpression does not visibly alter prostatic bud formation or branching morphogenesis, and Edar expression is not necessary for either of these events. However, Edar overexpression is associated with an abnormally thick and collagen-rich stroma in adult mouse prostates. These results support CTNNB1 as a transcriptional activator of Edar and Wnt10b in the developing prostate and demonstrate Edar is not only important for ectodermal appendage patterning but also influences collagen organization in adult prostates.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.},

The small amount of tissue obtained by renal biopsy has previously limited the ability to use patient samples for discovery purposes. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) is an ideal technology for quantitative interrogation of scarce samples, permitting concurrent analysis of more than 40 markers on a single tissue section. Using a validated panel of metal-conjugated antibodies designed to confer unique signatures on the structural and infiltrating cells comprising the human kidney, we performed simultaneous multiplexed imaging with IMC in 23 channels on 16 histopathologically normal human samples. We devised a machine-learning pipeline (Kidney-MAPPS) to perform single-cell segmentation, phenotyping, and quantification, thus creating a spatially preserved quantitative atlas of the normal human kidney. These data define selected baseline renal cell types, respective numbers, organization, and variability. We demonstrate the utility of IMC coupled to Kidney-MAPPS to qualitatively and quantitatively distinguish individual cell types and reveal expected as well as potentially novel abnormalities in diseased versus normal tissue. Our studies define a critical baseline data set for future quantitative analysis of human kidney disease.},

Here, we present a handheld automated microfluidic liquid handling system controlled by a smartphone, which is enabled by combining elastomeric on-chip valves and a compact pneumatic system. As a demonstration, we show that the system can automatically perform all the liquid handling steps of a bead-based HIV1 p24 sandwich immunoassay on a multi-layer PDMS chip without any human intervention. The footprint of the system is 6 × 10.5 × 16.5 cm, and the total weight is 829 g including battery. Powered by a 12.8 V 1500 mAh Li battery, the system consumed 2.2 W on average during the immunoassay and lasted for 8.7 h. This handheld microfluidic liquid handling platform is generally applicable to many biochemical and cell-based assays requiring complex liquid manipulation and sample preparation steps such as FISH, PCR, flow cytometry and nucleic acid sequencing. In particular, the integration of this technology with read-out biosensors may help enable the realization of the long-sought Tricorder-like handheld in vitro diagnostic (IVD) systems.},

At the present time, breath analysis in cetaceans has very limited practical applications, in large part due to lack of widely adopted sampling device(s) and methodologies that are well-standardized. Here, we present an optimized design and the operating principles of a portable apparatus for reproducible collection of exhaled breath condensate from small cetaceans, such as bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). The device design is optimized to meet two criteria: standardized collection and preservation of information-rich metabolomic content of the biological sample, and animal comfort and ease of breath sample collection.

Monitoring health conditions is essential to detect early asymptomatic stages of a disease. To achieve this, blood, urine and breath samples are commonly used as a routine clinical diagnostic. These samples offer the opportunity to detect specific metabolites related to diseases and provide a better understanding of their development. Although blood samples are commonly used routinely to monitor health, the implementation of a relatively noninvasive technique, such as exhaled breath condensate (EBC) analysis, may further benefit the well-being of both humans and other animals. EBC analysis can be used to track possible physical or biochemical alterations caused by common diseases of the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), such as infections or inflammatory-mediated processes. We have used an untargeted metabolomic method with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of EBC samples to determine biomarkers related to disease development. In this study, five dolphins under human care were followed up for 1 year. We collected paired blood, physical examination information, and EBC samples. We then statistically correlated this information to predict specific health alterations. Three dolphins provided promising case study information about biomarkers related to cutaneous infections, respiratory infections, dental disease, or hormonal changes (pregnancy). The use of complementary liquid chromatography platforms, with hydrophilic interaction chromatography and reverse-phased columns, allowed us to detect a wide spectrum of EBC biomarker compounds that could be related to these health alterations. Moreover, these two analytical techniques not only provided complementary metabolite information but in both cases they also provided promising diagnostic information for these health conditions.

Currently, there are no validated questionnaires to assess upper airway contribution to pediatric asthma symptoms. The Sino-Nasal 5 (SN-5) questionnaire was previously validated for identifying radiographic confirmed sinus disease in children. In this study, we hypothesize that significant SN-5 scores (≥3.5) are associated with abnormal National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) based asthma impairment and control in asthmatic children. Retrospective data collected on children with asthma referred for pulmonary evaluation included age, gender, ethnicity, NAEPP asthma severity, asthma control (Test for Respiratory and Asthma Control in Kids (TRACK) {\textless} 5 years, Asthma Control Test (ACT) 5 years) and pulmonary function testing. Associations between SN-5 scores and asthma impairment and control were identified. Seventy-six children were evaluated; 38\% were female with a mean age of 6.9 years. Significant SN-5 scores were associated with decreased control of daytime symptoms (odds ratio (OR): 0.16 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.06-0.44)), night time awakenings (0.09 (0.03-0.29)), activity interference (0.2 (0.06-0.68)), NAEPP defined asthma control (0.32 (0.12-0.85)) and poor asthma control based on TRACK (p {\textless} 0.001) and ACT (p {\textless} 0.001).

One of the persistent problems hampering the wide application of the breath analysis method is measurement variability of metabolite abundances stemming from differences in both sampling and analysis methodologies used in various studies. Mass spectrometry has been a  method of choice for comprehensive metabolomic analysis. For the first time in the present study, we juxtapose the most commonly employed mass spectrometry-based analysis methodologies and directly compare the resultant coverages of detected compounds in exhaled breath condensate in order to guide methodology choices for exhaled breath condensate analysis studies. Four methods  were explored to broaden the range of measured compounds across both the volatile and non-volatile domain. Liquid phase sampling with polyacrylate Solid-Phase MicroExtraction fiber, liquid phase extraction with a polydimethylsiloxane patch, and headspace sampling using Carboxen/Polydimethylsiloxane Solid-Phase MicroExtraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry were tested for the analysis of volatile fraction. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and reversed-phase chromatography high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry were used for analysis of non-volatile fraction. We found that liquid phase breath condensate extraction was notably superior compared to headspace extraction and differences in employed sorbents manifested  altered metabolite coverages. The most pronounced effect was substantially enhanced metabolite capture for larger, higher-boiling compounds using polyacrylate SPME liquid phase sampling. The analysis of the non-volatile fraction of breath condensate by hydrophilic and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry indicated orthogonal metabolite coverage  by these chromatography modes. We found that the metabolite coverage could be enhanced significantly with the use of organic solvent as a device rinse after breath sampling to collect the non-aqueous fraction as opposed to neat breath condensate sample. Here, we show the detected ranges of compounds in each case and provide a practical guide for methodology selection for optimal detection of  specific compounds.},

While the noninvasive detection of metabolites in exhaled breath could potentially help to address this problem, there exists a knowledge gap regarding  associations between known disease states and breath metabolite profiles in cetaceans. This technology was applied to the largest marine oil spill in U.S. history (The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico). An accurate analysis was performed to test for associations between the exhaled breath metabolome and sonographic lung abnormalities as well as hematological, serum biochemical, and endocrine hormone parameters. Importantly, metabolites consistent with chronic inflammation, such as products of lung epithelial cellular breakdown and arachidonic acid cascade metabolites were associated with  sonographic evidence of lung consolidation. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) metabolite profiles also correlated with serum hormone concentrations (cortisol and aldosterone), hepatobiliary enzyme levels, white blood cell counts, and iron  homeostasis. The correlations among breath metabolites and conventional health measures suggest potential application of breath sampling for remotely assessing  health of wild cetaceans.

	abstract = {The non-invasive, quick, and safe collection of exhaled breath condensate makes it a candidate as a diagnostic matrix in personalized health monitoring devices. The lack of standardization in collection methods and sample analysis is a persistent limitation preventing its practical use. The collection method and hardware design are recognized to significantly affect the metabolomic content of EBC samples, but this has not been systematically studied.

Here, we completed a series of experiments to determine the sole effect of collection temperature on the metabolomic content of EBC. Temperature is a likely parameter that can be controlled to standardize among different devices. The study considered six temperature levels covering two physical phases of the sample; liquid and solid. The use of a single device in our study allowed keeping saliva filtering and collector surface effects as constant parameters and the temperature as a controlled variable; the physiological differences were minimized by averaging samples from a group of volunteers and a period of time. After EBC collection, we used an organic solvent rinse to collect the non-water-soluble compounds from the condenser surface. This additional matrix enhanced metabolites recovery, was less dependent on temperature changes, and may possibly serve as an additional pointer to standardize EBC sampling methodologies. The collected EBC samples were analyzed with a set of mass spectrometry methods to provide an overview of the compounds and their concentrations present at each temperature level.

The total number of volatile and polar non-volatile compounds slightly increased in each physical phase as the collection temperature was lowered to minimum, 0 °C for liquid and −30, −56 °C for solid. The low-polarity non-volatile compounds showed a weak dependence on the collection temperature. The metabolomic content of EBC samples may not be solely dependent on temperature but may be influenced by other phenomena such as greater sample dilution due to condensation from the ambient air at colder temperatures, or due to adhesion properties of the collector surface and occurring chemical reactions. The relative importance of other design parameters such as condenser coating versus temperature requires further investigation.},

Here, we report on a gradient-based colorimetric sensor (GCS) to overcome this limitation. Lateral transport of analytes across a colorimetric sensor surface creates a color gradient that shifts along the transport direction over time, and GCS tracks the gradient shift and converts it into analyte concentration in real time. Using a low cost complementary metal-oxide semiconductor imager and imaging processing algorithm, we show submicrometer gradient shift tracking precision and continuous monitoring of ppb-level ozone.},

The current "gold standard" for blood gas measurements involves obtaining blood samples, which can be painful and can lead to bleeding, thrombus formation, or infection. Mass transfer equilibrium-based transcutaneous blood gas monitors have been used since the 1970s, but they require heating the skin to ≥42 °C to speed up the transcutaneous gas diffusion. Thus, these devices have a potential risk for skin burns. Here we report a new generation of noninvasive device for respiratory status assessment. Instead of waiting for mass transfer equilibrium, the blood gas levels are monitored by measuring the transcutaneous diffusion rate, which is proportional to blood gas concentration. The startup time of this device is almost independent of skin temperature, so the measurement can be made at any body temperature. The test results show that this device can track the blood gas levels quickly even at normal body temperature.},

	abstract = {Designing mobile devices for the analysis of complex sample mixtures containing a variety of analytes at different concentrations across a large dynamic range remains a challenging task in many analytical scenarios. To meet this challenge,  a compact hybrid analytical platform has been developed combining Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy based on substrate-integrated hollow waveguides (iHWG-FTIR) with gas chromatography coupled differential mobility spectrometry (GC-DMS). Due to the complementarity of these techniques regarding analyte type and concentration, their combination provides a promising tool for the detection  of complex samples containing a broad range of molecules at different concentrations. To date, the combination of infrared spectroscopy and ion mobility techniques remains expensive and bound to a laboratory utilizing e.g. IMS as prefilter or IR as ionization source. In the present study, a cost-efficient and portable solution has been developed and characterized representing the first truly hyphenated IR-DMS system. As a model analyte mixture, 5 ppm isopropylmercaptan (IPM) in methane (CH4) were diluted, and the concentration-dependent DMS signal of IPM along with the concentration-dependent  IR signal of CH4 were recorded for all three hybrid IR-DMS systems. While guiding the sample through the iHWG-FTIR or the GC-DMS first did not affect the obtained  signals, optimizing the IR data acquisition parameters did benefit the analytical results.},

The condenser is installed in a battery-operated hand-held breath sampling device. The device performance is characterized by the collection and analysis of exhaled breath samples from a group of volunteers. The exhaled breath condensate is collected on a subcooled condenser surface, transferred into a storage vial, and its chemical  content is analyzed using mass spectrometric methods. The engineered surface supports upon it a continuous condensation cycle, and this allows the collection  of liquid samples exceeding the saturation mass/area limit of a plain hydrophilic surface. The condenser surface employs two constituent parameters: a low surface  energy barrier to enhance nucleation and condensation efficiency, and a network of surface microstructures to create a self-cleaning mechanism for fluid aggregation into a reservoir. Removal of the liquid condensate from the condenser surface prevents the formation of a thick liquid layer, and thus maintains a continuous condensation cycle with a minimum decrease in heat transfer efficiency as condensation occurs on the surface. The self-cleaning condenser surfaces may have a number of applications in the collection of biological, chemical, or environmental aerosol samples. Sample phase conversion to liquid can facilitate sample manipulation and chemical analysis of matrices with low concentrations. Here, we demonstrate the use of a self-cleaning microcondenser for the collection of exhaled breath condensate with a hand-held portable device. All breath collections with the two devices were performed with the same group of volunteers under UC Davis IRB protocol 63701-3.},

To understand the origin of this metabolic process, our group has previously analyzed the headspace above  human epithelial cell cultures using solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS). In the present work, we improve our model by employing sorbent-covered magnetic stir bars for headspace sorptive  extraction (HSSE). Sorbent-coated stir bar analyte recovery increased by 52 times and captured 97 more compounds than SPME. Our data show that HSSE is preferred over liquid extraction via stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE), which failed to distinguish volatiles unique to the cell samples compared against media controls. Two different cellular media were also compared, and we found that Opti-MEM(R) is preferred for volatile analysis. We optimized HSSE analytical parameters such as  extraction time (24h), desorption temperature (300 degrees C) and desorption time (7min). Finally, we developed an internal standard for cell culture VOC studies by introducing 842ng of deuterated decane per 5mL of cell medium to account for error from extraction, desorption, chromatography and detection. This improved model will serve as a platform for future metabolic cell culture studies to examine changes in epithelial VOCs caused by perturbations such as viral or bacterial infections, opening opportunities for improved, noninvasive pulmonary diagnostics.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Time-resolved quantification of physical activity can contribute to both personalized medicine and epidemiological research studies, for example, managing and identifying triggers of asthma exacerbations. A growing number of reportedly accurate machine learning algorithms for human activity recognition (HAR) have been developed using data from wearable devices (eg, smartwatch and smartphone). However, many HAR algorithms depend on fixed-size sampling windows that may poorly adapt to real-world conditions in which activity bouts are of unequal duration. A small sliding window can produce noisy predictions under stable conditions, whereas a large sliding window may miss brief bursts of intense activity. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to create an HAR framework adapted to variable duration activity bouts by (1) detecting the change points of activity bouts in a multivariate time series and (2) predicting activity for each homogeneous window defined by these change points. METHODS: We applied standard fixed-width sliding windows (4-6 different sizes) or greedy Gaussian segmentation (GGS) to identify break points in filtered triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope data. After standard feature engineering, we applied an Xgboost model to predict  physical activity within each window and then converted windowed predictions to instantaneous predictions to facilitate comparison across segmentation methods. We applied these methods in 2 datasets: the human activity recognition using smartphones (HARuS) dataset where a total of 30 adults performed activities of approximately equal duration (approximately 20 seconds each) while wearing a waist-worn smartphone, and the Biomedical REAl-Time Health Evaluation for Pediatric Asthma (BREATHE) dataset where a total of 14 children performed 6 activities for approximately 10 min each while wearing a smartwatch. To mimic a real-world scenario, we generated artificial unequal activity bout durations in the BREATHE data by randomly subdividing each activity bout into 10 segments and  randomly concatenating the 60 activity bouts. Each dataset was divided into {\textasciitilde}90\%  training and {\textasciitilde}10\% holdout testing. RESULTS: In the HARuS data, GGS produced the least noisy predictions of 6 physical activities and had the second highest accuracy rate of 91.06\% (the highest accuracy rate was 91.79\% for the sliding window of size 0.8 second). In the BREATHE data, GGS again produced the least noisy predictions and had the highest accuracy rate of 79.4\% of predictions for 6 physical activities. CONCLUSIONS: In a scenario with variable duration activity bouts, GGS multivariate segmentation produced smart-sized windows with more stable predictions and a higher accuracy rate than traditional fixed-size sliding window approaches. Overall, accuracy was good in both datasets but, as expected,  it was slightly lower in the more real-world study using wrist-worn smartwatches  in children (BREATHE) than in the more tightly controlled study using waist-worn  smartphones in adults (HARuS). We implemented GGS in an offline setting, but it could be adapted for real-time prediction with streaming data.},

Efforts for prevention and management could be supported by an understanding of the relative importance of determinants, including environmental exposures. Thus, we aim to develop a prediction model for bronchitic symptoms. METHODS: Schoolchildren from the population-based southern California Children's Health Study were visited annually from 2003 to 2012. Bronchitic symptoms over the prior 12 months were assessed by questionnaire. A gradient boosting model was fit using groups of risk factors (including traffic/air pollution exposures) for all children and by asthma status. Training data consisted of one observation per participant in a random study year (for 50\% of participants). Validation data consisted of: (1) a random (later) year in the same participants (within-participant); (2) a random year in participants excluded from the training data (across-participant). RESULTS: At baseline, 13.2\% of children had asthma and 18.1\% reported bronchitic symptoms. Models performed similarly within- and across-participant. Previous year symptoms/medication use provided much of the predictive ability (across-participant area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): 0.76 vs 0.78 for all risk factors, in all participants). Traffic/air pollution exposures added modestly to prediction as did body mass index percentile, age and parent stress. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of asthma status, previous symptoms were the most important predictors of current symptoms. Traffic/air pollution variables contribute modest predictive information, but impact large populations. Methods proposed here could be generalized to personalized exacerbation predictions in future longitudinal studies to support targeted prevention efforts.},

There is a clinical need to identify biomarkers of oxidative stress which could potentially support early indicators of disease and health management. To identify volatile biomarkers of oxidative stress, we analyzed the headspace above human bronchial epithelial cell cultures (HBE1) before and after hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and cigarette smoke extract (CSE) exposure. Using stir bar and headspace sorptive extraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, we searched for volatile organic compounds (VOC) of these oxidative measures. In the H2O2 cell peroxidation experiments, four different H2O2 concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 10, 50 mM) were applied to the HBE1 cells, and VOCs were collected every 12 h over the time course of 48 h. In the cigarette smoke extract cell peroxidation experiments, four different smoke extract concentrations (0, 10, 30, 60 \%) were applied to the cells, and VOCs were collected every 12 h over the time course of 48 h. We used partial-least squares (PLS) analysis to identify putative compounds from the mass spectrometry results that highly correlated with the known applied oxidative stress. We observed chemical emissions from the cells that related to both the intensity of the oxidative stress and followed distinct time courses. Additionally, some of these chemicals are aldehydes, which are thought to be non-invasive indicators of oxidative stress in exhaled human breath. Together, these results illustrate a powerful in situ cell culture model of oxidative stress that can be used to explore the putative biological genesis of exhaled breath biomarkers that are often observed in human clinical studies.},

reliability by comparing the sensor to an exact copy of itself under

	abstract = {Respiration is a vital activity for proper body functioning. Monitoring respiration not only aids in assessing our health but also helps in anticipating obstructive disorders such as sleep apnea and asthma. Typical systems for monitoring respiration such as nasal masks and chest band are cramped on a user's body. These are wired and require a user to be stationary when measurements are taken. Wireless wearable devices for breathing rate estimation are straps around the chest that hinder chest wall movement due to tensile limitations. To mitigate these challenges, in this paper we present a wireless system for continuous monitoring of breathing using a wearable micro radar. The radar measures the movement of the chest wall. We design a signal processing algorithm for noise cancellation and breathing rate determination. Using an evaluation on ten human subjects, we show that our system can measure breathing rate continuously with an accuracy of 95\%.},

It introduces some of the challenges that portable systems face and identify a few future directions and emerging trends in the field. The chapter focuses on ion mobility devices, metal oxide–based sensors, and chemical analysis systems, including micro-gas chromatography technologies and e-nose devices. It argues that the machine learning, pattern recognition, and statistical learning methods will be used interchangeably. One of the most common types of miniature chemical sensors is the metal oxide gas sensor. In fact, metal oxide–based carbon monoxide and combustible gas sensors have been commercially available since the 1970s for use in automotive monitoring, air quality monitoring, and other toxic gas detection applications. At the core, metal oxide–based sensors rely on electrical impedance changing as a function of gas composition and concentration.},

Automated algorithm-based DMS dispersion plot data analysis method was applied for the first time to pre-process and separate 3-dimensional (3-D) DMS dispersion data. We previously demonstrated our AnalyzeIMS (AIMS) software was capable of analyzing complex gas chromatography differential mobility spectrometry (GC-DMS) data sets. In our present work, the AIMS software was able to easily separate DMS dispersion data sets of five chemicals that are important in detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs): 2-butanone, 2-propanone, ethyl acetate, methanol and ethanol. Identification of chemicals from mixtures, separation of chemicals from a mixture and prediction capability of the software were all tested. These automated algorithms may have potential applications in separation of chemicals (or ion peaks) from other 3-D data obtained by hybrid analytical devices such as mass spectrometry (MS). New algorithm developments are included as future considerations to improve the current numerical approaches to fingerprint chemicals (ions) from a significantly complicated dispersion plot. Comprehensive peak identification by DMS-MS, variations of the DMS data due to chemical concentration, gas phase ion chemistry, temperature and pressure of the drift gas are considered in future algorithm improvements.},

The development of microprocessors for general use, such as the Arduino prototyping platform, now enables custom chemical analysis instrumentation. We have created an example system using commercially available parts, centered around on differential mobility spectrometer (DMS) device. The Modular Reconfigurable Gas Chromatography - Differential Mobility Spectrometry package (MR-GC-DMS) has swappable components allowing it to be quickly reconfigured for specific application purposes as well as broad, generic use. The MR-GC-DMS has a custom user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) and precisely tuned proportional-integral-derivative controller (PID) feedback control system managing individual temperature-sensitive components.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Time-resolved quantification of physical activity can contribute to both personalized medicine and epidemiological research studies, for example, managing and identifying triggers of asthma exacerbations. A growing number of reportedly accurate machine learning algorithms for human activity recognition (HAR) have been developed using data from wearable devices (eg, smartwatch and smartphone). However, many HAR algorithms depend on fixed-size sampling windows that may poorly adapt to real-world conditions in which activity bouts are of unequal duration. A small sliding window can produce noisy predictions under stable conditions, whereas a large sliding window may miss brief bursts of intense activity. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to create an HAR framework adapted to variable duration activity bouts by (1) detecting the change points of activity bouts in a multivariate time series and (2) predicting activity for each homogeneous window defined by these change points. METHODS: We applied standard fixed-width sliding windows (4-6 different sizes) or greedy Gaussian segmentation (GGS) to identify break points in filtered triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope data. After standard feature engineering, we applied an Xgboost model to predict  physical activity within each window and then converted windowed predictions to instantaneous predictions to facilitate comparison across segmentation methods. We applied these methods in 2 datasets: the human activity recognition using smartphones (HARuS) dataset where a total of 30 adults performed activities of approximately equal duration (approximately 20 seconds each) while wearing a waist-worn smartphone, and the Biomedical REAl-Time Health Evaluation for Pediatric Asthma (BREATHE) dataset where a total of 14 children performed 6 activities for approximately 10 min each while wearing a smartwatch. To mimic a real-world scenario, we generated artificial unequal activity bout durations in the BREATHE data by randomly subdividing each activity bout into 10 segments and  randomly concatenating the 60 activity bouts. Each dataset was divided into {\textasciitilde}90\%  training and {\textasciitilde}10\% holdout testing. RESULTS: In the HARuS data, GGS produced the least noisy predictions of 6 physical activities and had the second highest accuracy rate of 91.06\% (the highest accuracy rate was 91.79\% for the sliding window of size 0.8 second). In the BREATHE data, GGS again produced the least noisy predictions and had the highest accuracy rate of 79.4\% of predictions for 6 physical activities. CONCLUSIONS: In a scenario with variable duration activity bouts, GGS multivariate segmentation produced smart-sized windows with more stable predictions and a higher accuracy rate than traditional fixed-size sliding window approaches. Overall, accuracy was good in both datasets but, as expected,  it was slightly lower in the more real-world study using wrist-worn smartwatches  in children (BREATHE) than in the more tightly controlled study using waist-worn  smartphones in adults (HARuS). We implemented GGS in an offline setting, but it could be adapted for real-time prediction with streaming data.},

Mouse models of Apert and Crouzon craniosynostosis syndromes exhibit midface dysgenesis similar to the human conditions. They carry activating mutations of Fgfr2, which is expressed in multiple craniofacial tissues during development. Magnetic resonance microscopy of three mouse models of Apert and Crouzon syndromes revealed decreased nasal passage volume in all models at birth. Histological analysis suggested overgrowth of the nasal cartilage in the two Apert syndrome mouse models. We used tissue-specific gene expression and transcriptome analysis to further dissect the structural, cellular and molecular alterations underlying midface and upper airway dysgenesis in Apert Fgfr2+/S252W mutants. Cartilage thickened progressively during embryogenesis because of increased chondrocyte proliferation in the presence of Fgf2. Oral epithelium expression of mutant Fgfr2, which resulted in a distinctive nasal septal fusion defect, and premature facial suture fusion contributed to the overall dysmorphology. Midface dysgenesis in Fgfr2-related craniosynostosis is a complex phenotype arising from the combined effects of aberrant signaling in multiple craniofacial tissues.},

Optimisation of differentiation conditions allowed the formation of micro-organoids, each containing six to ten nephrons that were surrounded by endothelial and stromal populations. Single cell transcriptional profiling confirmed the presence and transcriptional equivalence of all anticipated renal cell types consistent with a previous organoid culture method. This suspension culture micro-organoid methodology resulted in a three- to fourfold increase in final cell yield compared with static culture, thereby representing an economical approach to the production of kidney cells for various biological applications.},

	abstract = {Nephron formation continues throughout kidney morphogenesis in both mice and humans. Lineage tracing studies in mice identified a self‐renewing Six2‐expressing nephron progenitor population able to give rise to the full complement of nephrons throughout kidney morphogenesis. To investigate the origin of nephrons within human pluripotent stem cell‐derived kidney organoids, we performed a similar fate‐mapping analysis of the SIX2‐expressing lineage in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)‐derived kidney organoids to explore the feasibility of investigating lineage relationships in differentiating iPSCs in vitro. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene‐edited lineage reporter lines, we show that SIX2‐expressing cells give rise to nephron epithelial cell types but not to presumptive ureteric epithelium. The use of an inducible (CreERT2) line revealed a declining capacity for SIX2+ cells to contribute to nephron formation over time, but retention of nephron‐forming capacity if provided an exogenous WNT signal. Hence, while human iPSC‐derived kidney tissue appears to maintain lineage relationships previously identified in developing mouse kidney, unlike the developing kidney in vivo, kidney organoids lack a nephron progenitor niche capable of both self‐renewal and ongoing nephrogenesis.EMBO Reports (2019) e47483},

Here we compare 3D human glomeruli sieved from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney organoids with conditionally immortalised human podocyte cell lines, revealing improved podocyte-specific gene expression, maintenance in vitro of polarised protein localisation and an improved glomerular basement membrane matrisome compared to 2D cultures. Organoid-derived glomeruli retain marker expression in culture for 96 h, proving amenable to toxicity screening. In addition, 3D organoid glomeruli from a congenital nephrotic syndrome patient with compound heterozygous NPHS1 mutations reveal reduced protein levels of both NEPHRIN and PODOCIN.

We found that vascularized kidney organoids cultured under flow had more mature podocyte and tubular compartments with enhanced cellular polarity and adult gene expression compared with that in static controls. Glomerular vascular development progressed through intermediate stages akin to those involved in the embryonic mammalian kidney’s formation of capillary loops abutting foot processes.

Outstanding challenges exist, however, in reconstructing the complex architecture, cellular make-up, and matrix composition necessary for the proper modeling of kidney function. Herein, the first fully tunable human kidney-on-a-chip platform is reported that allows the reconstruction of the native architecture of the renal endothelial-epithelial exchange interface using entirely cell-remodelable matrix and patient-derived kidney cells. This platform consists of a double-layer human renal vascular-tubular unit (hRVTU) enabled by a thin collagen membrane that replicates the kidney exchange interface. It is shown that endothelial and epithelial cells  lining their respective lumens remodel the membrane in culture into a approximately 1 microm thick exchange interface composed of native basement membrane proteins. This interface displays sufficient mechanical integrity for media flow and blood perfusion. As a proof of principle, it is demonstrated that  the hRVTU performs kidney-specific functions including reabsorption of albumin and glucose from the epithelial channel. By incorporating multiple cell populations from single donors, it is demonstrated that the hRVTU may have utility for future precision medicine applications. The success of the system provides new opportunities for the next generation of organ-on-a-chip models.},

To overcome this we developed a new tool to simultaneously fate map two distinct cell types in the kidney, and genetically test whether cells of renin lineage (CoRL) can transdifferentiate to a podocyte fate. Ren1cCreER/ tdTomato/Nphs1-FLPo/FRT-EGFP mice (CoRL-PODO mice) were generated by crossing Ren1c-CreER/tdTomato CoRL reporter mice with Nphs1-FLPo/FRT-EGFP podocyte reporter mice. Following tamoxifen administration in these animals, CoRL were labeled with red fluorescence (tdTomato) and co-localized with renin. Podocytes were labeled green (enhanced green fluorescent protein) and co-localized with nephrin. Following podocyte loss by nephrotoxic antibody and subsequent enalapril-enhanced partial replacement, tdTomato-EGFP-labeled CoRL were detected as yellow- colored cells in a subset of glomerular tufts, without the use of antibodies. Co-localization with podocin indicated that these cells are podocytes, derived from CoRL origin. Thus, our novel study shows that two distinct cell types can be simultaneously labeled in the mouse kidney and provide strong genetic evidence in vivo that lost podocytes can be replaced in part by CoRL.},

	abstract = {Exposomic research may utilize multiple sensors to measure individuals' environment and
their physiological responses. These sensors measure physical, chemical and biological properties and have wide variations in their capabilities and performance. It is therefore important to provide sensor characterization information in order to make appropriate decisions when selecting and utilizing sensors for research studies and analysis or when performing meta-studies aggregating data from multiple sensors. In this presentation, we discuss the development, organization, and use of a sensor metadata library (SML) developed by the Utah PRISMS Informatics Ecosystem (UPIE) (Grant NIH NIBIB U54EB021973). We performed a needs assessment and utilized the sensor common
metadata specifications (SCMS) developed by UPIE in designing the SML. SCMS contains sensor metadata pertaining to the physical device, their deployment and resulting measurement outputs. The SML includes domains describing the physical characteristics of devices, including hardware and software versioning, measurement and/or sample collection characteristics, validation protocols, ownership and additional technical documentation. We implemented the SML using the Ne04j graph database. The SML includes tools for capturing and discovering metadata for new and updated versions of sensors. Sensor owners can submit metadata to the SML using a REDCap survey form, which is then curated and stored. Researchers can visualize stored sensor metadata graphically as interlinked nodes of information. This SML serves as a researcher-facing tool - as a repository of sensor information for researchers to design their exposomic studies and understand their limitations; and an inventory of available sensors for prospective study deployments. It also serves as a source of metadata store for the UPIE for performing semantically consistent metadata driven integration of heterogeneous sensor data streams for exposomic study analysis.},

	abstract = {Exposomic research is an emerging field of study that seeks to address environmental
exposures and its effects on life, health, and disease development. Research using exposomic data includes those related to the research and development of sensor devices, chemistry of environmental species and exposure pathways. Concurrently, with the increase in biomedical research interests and advances in exposome data collection, data are increasingly available.1 In order to support such translational exposomic studies, there is a need for an informatics infrastructure along with tools to facilitate access and use by investigators. However, to date, there is no standard or systematic way to model a translational exposomic research study. To support research using personalized and environmental sensor devices, we developed a model for exposomic studies to cover the design, conduct and analytic phases of a study. We reviewed existing study metadata representations and compared them with a sample of publicly available exposome studies from the literature and others elicited from researchers. Gaps were found in how sensor data are represented in the existing study metadata models and in general, a lack of detail into data requirements for exposome studies; all needed for an informatics infrastructure. To address these gaps we consolidated data elements from existing domain specific models. In particular, we incorporated the Sensor Common Metadata Specification (SCMS) into the model. The SCMS is currently being implemented in the Utah PRISMS Informatics Ecosystem (UPIE) and includes metadata of measured data from sensors, the deployment of sensors, and the sensors itself.2 This model is currently being validated within UPIE for reproducible representations of exposomic studies, and computable specification of study data integration, to support the study of effects of the environment on health and advance the science in this area.},

	abstract = {The concept of the exposome include endogenous processes within the body, biological
responses of adaptation to environment, and socio-behavioral factors beyond assessment of

influences, and resulting direct biological pathway alterations as well as mutagenic and epigenetic
changes on the phenome. Data representing these events need to be associated with their
limitations and uncertainties associated with using the data as exact quantifications of exposure. In
order to address these needs, we are developing a metadata-driven exposomic data integration
platform, OpenFurther (OF), as a part of the Utah Pediatric Research using Integrated Sensor
Monitoring Systems (PRISMS) Informatics Ecosystem (Grant NIH NIBIB U54EB021973). Based on the
methods used for data collection (measurement or observation), and the differences and
uncertainties in environmental measurements and true exposures, we grouped exposomic events
into six broad categories: Sensor, Clinical, Biospecimen-derived, Participant reported, Aggregates,
and Computational Models. Each of these events have spatio-temporal coordinates that can be
unbounded, dense, discrete, instants \& intervals, indeterminate, and at finest granularity available
with the source. OF generates these event from heterogeneous study data and stores them as
documents in Big Data stores. These high-resolution exposome records are used for spatio-temporal
abstraction, reasoning and Big Data analytics methods. They can also be transformed with minimal
transformational information loss into analytical models to support a diverse set of translational
research archetypes including sensor development, environmental chemistry, exposure pathways,
mechanistic understanding of environmental species on the genome for precision medicine,
pharmacodynamics studies, clinical trials, observational, comparative effectiveness, and

Co-culture of KG1 cells with endothelium stabilizes capillary formation. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis during differentiation identified autocrine ligand-receptor pair upregulation and a strong focal adhesion pathway signal. This led us to test the serum response factor inhibitor CCG-203971 which potently inhibited TGFb-induced pericyte to myofibroblast transition. scRNA-seq also identified the unexpected upregulation of nerve growth factor (NGF) which we confirmed in two mouse kidney fibrosis models. The Ngf receptor Ntrk1 is expressed in tubular epithelium in vivo, suggesting a novel interstitial to tubule paracrine signaling axis. Thus KG1 cells accurately model myofibroblast activation in vitro, and the development of this cell line provides a new tool to study resident mesenchymal stem cell-like progenitors in health and disease.},

By contrast, the techniques used to analyze renal biopsy specimens have changed little over several decades. We tested the hypothesis that single-cell RNA-sequencing can comprehensively describe cell types and states in a human kidney biopsy specimen.

Methods We generated 8746 single-cell transcriptomes from a healthy adult kidney and a single kidney transplant biopsy core by single-cell RNA-sequencing. Unsupervised clustering analysis of the biopsy specimen was performed to identify 16 distinct cell types, including all of the major immune cell types and most native kidney cell types, in this biopsy specimen, for which the histologic read was mixed rejection.

Results Monocytes formed two subclusters representing a nonclassical CD16+ group and a classic CD16− group expressing dendritic cell maturation markers. The presence of both monocyte cell subtypes was validated by staining of independent transplant biopsy specimens. Comparison of healthy kidney epithelial transcriptomes with biopsy specimen counterparts identified novel segment-specific proinflammatory responses in rejection. Endothelial cells formed three distinct subclusters: resting cells and two activated endothelial cell groups. One activated endothelial cell group expressed Fc receptor pathway activation and Ig internalization genes, consistent with the pathologic diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection. We mapped previously defined genes that associate with rejection outcomes to single cell types and generated a searchable online gene expression database.

Conclusions We present the first step toward incorporation of single-cell transcriptomics into kidney biopsy specimen interpretation, describe a heterogeneous immune response in mixed rejection, and provide a searchable resource for the scientific community.},

Both generate kidney organoids that contain a diverse range of kidney cells at differing ratios as well as non-renal cell types. We quantified the differentiation state of major organoid kidney cell types by comparing them against a 4,259 single nucleus RNA-seq dataset generated from adult human kidney, revealing immaturity of all kidney organoid cell types. We reconstructed lineage relationships during organoid differentiation through pseudotemporal ordering, and identified transcription factor networks associated with fate decisions.

Single-cell transcriptome analyses of 6414 cells from five individual specimens identified 11 initial clusters of specific renal cell types as defined by their gene expression profile. Further subclustering identifies progenitors, and mature and intermediate stages of differentiation for several renal lineages.

Podocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-podocytes) have recently been generated in nephron-like kidney organoids, but the developmental stage of these cells and their capacity to reveal disease mechanisms remains unclear. Here, we show that hPSC-podocytes phenocopy mammalian podocytes at the capillary loop stage (CLS), recapitulating key features of ultrastructure, gene expression, and mutant phenotype. hPSC-podocytes in vitro progressively establish junction-rich basal membranes (nephrin+ podocin+ ZO-1+ ) and microvillus-rich apical membranes (podocalyxin+ ), similar to CLS podocytes in vivo. Ultrastructural, biophysical, and transcriptomic analysis of podocalyxin-knockout hPSCs and derived podocytes, generated using CRISPR/Cas9, reveals defects in the assembly of microvilli and lateral spaces between developing podocytes, resulting in failed junctional migration. These defects are phenocopied in CLS glomeruli of podocalyxin-deficient mice, which cannot produce urine, thereby demonstrating that podocalyxin has a conserved and essential role in mammalian podocyte maturation. Defining the maturity of hPSC-podocytes and their capacity to reveal and recapitulate pathophysiological mechanisms establishes a powerful framework for studying human kidney disease and regeneration.

Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) analysis is a developing field with tremendous promise to advance personalized, non-invasive health diagnostics as new analytical instrumentation platforms and detection methods are developed. Multiple commercially-available and researcher-built experimental samplers are reported in the literature. However, there is very limited information available to determine an effective breath sampling approach, especially regarding the dependence of breath sample metabolomic content on the collection device design and sampling methodology. This lack of an optimal standard procedure results in a range of reported results that are sometimes contradictory. Here, we present a design of a portable human EBC sampler optimized for collection and preservation of the rich metabolomic content of breath. The performance of the engineered device is compared to two commercially available breath collection devices: the RTube ™ and TurboDECCS. A number of design and performance parameters are considered, including: condenser temperature stability during sampling, collection efficiency, condenser material choice, and saliva contamination in the collected breath samples. The significance of the biological content of breath samples, collected with each device, is evaluated with a set of mass spectrometry methods and was the primary factor for evaluating device performance. The design includes an adjustable mass-size threshold for aerodynamic filtering of saliva droplets from the breath flow. Engineering an inexpensive device that allows efficient collection of metalomic-rich breath samples is intended to aid further advancement in the field of breath analysis for non-invasive health diagnostic. EBC sampling from human volunteers was performed under UC Davis IRB protocol 63701-3 (09/30/2014–07/07/2017).},

	abstract = {The kidney vasculature facilitates the excretion of wastes, the dissemination of hormones, and the regulation of blood chemistry. To carry out these diverse functions, the vasculature is regionalized within the kidney and along the nephron. However, when and how endothelial regionalization occurs remains unknown. Here, we examine the developing kidney vasculature to assess its 3-dimensional structure and transcriptional heterogeneity. First, we observe that endothelial cells (ECs) grow coordinately with the kidney bud as early as E10.5, and begin to show signs of speci cation by E13.5 when the  rst arteries can be identi ed. We then focus on how ECs pattern and remodel with respect to the developing nephron and collecting duct epithelia. ECs circumscribe nephron progenitor populations at the distal tips of the ureteric bud (UB) tree and form stereotyped cruciform structures around each tip. Beginning at the renal vesicle (RV) stage, ECs form a continuous plexus around developing nephrons. The endothelial plexus envelops and elaborates with the maturing nephron, becoming preferentially enriched along the early distal tubule. Lastly, we perform transcriptional and immuno uorescent screens to characterize spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the kidney vasculature and identify novel regionally enriched genes. A better understanding of development of the kidney vasculature will help instruct engineering of properly vascularized ex vivo kidneys and evaluate diseased kidneys.},

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA-seq is a powerful technique. Nevertheless, there are important limitations, including the technical challenges of breaking down an organ or tissue into a single-cell suspension. Invariably, this has required enzymatic incubation at 37°C, which can be expected to result in artifactual changes in gene expression patterns. Here, we describe a dissociation method that uses a protease with high activity in the cold, purified from a psychrophilic microorganism. The entire procedure is carried out at 6°C or colder, at which temperature mammalian transcriptional machinery is largely inactive, thereby effectively ‘freezing in’ the in vivo gene expression patterns. To test this method, we carried out RNA-seq on 20,424 single cells from postnatal day 1 mouse kidneys, comparing the results of the psychrophilic protease method with procedures using 37°C incubation. We show that the cold protease method provides a great reduction in gene expression artifacts. In addition, the results produce a single-cell resolution gene expression atlas of the newborn mouse kidney, an interesting time in development when mature nephrons are present yet nephrogenesis remains extremely active.},

	volume = {27},
	doi = {doi: 10.1016/j.ebiom.2017.12.016},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND:
During normal human kidney development, nephrogenesis (the formation of nephrons) is complete by term birth, with the majority of nephrons formed late in gestation. The aim of this study was to morphologically examine nephrogenesis in fetal human kidneys from 20 to 41weeks of gestation.

METHODS:
Kidney samples were obtained at autopsy from 71 infants that died acutely in utero or within 24h after birth. Using image analysis, nephrogenic zone width, the number of glomerular generations, renal corpuscle cross-sectional area and the cellular composition of glomeruli were examined. Kidneys from female and male infants were analysed separately.

FINDINGS:
The number of glomerular generations formed within the fetal kidneys was directly proportional to gestational age, body weight and kidney weight, with variability between individuals in the ultimate number of generations (8 to 12) and in the timing of the cessation of nephrogenesis (still ongoing at 37weeks gestation in one infant). There was a slight but significant (r2=0.30, P=0.001) increase in renal corpuscle cross-sectional area from mid gestation to term in females, but this was not evident in males. The proportions of podocytes, endothelial and non-epithelial cells within mature glomeruli were stable throughout gestation.

INTERPRETATION:
These findings highlight spatial and temporal variability in nephrogenesis in the developing human kidney, whereas the relative cellular composition of glomeruli does not appear to be influenced by gestational age.},

	doi = {doi: 10.1681/ASN.2017080887},
	abstract = {Human kidney function is underpinned by approximately 1,000,000 nephrons, although the number varies substantially, and low nephron number is linked to disease. Human kidney development initiates around 4 weeks of gestation and ends around 34-37 weeks of gestation. Over this period, a reiterative inductive process establishes the nephron complement. Studies have provided insightful anatomic descriptions of human kidney development, but the limited histologic views are not readily accessible to a broad audience. In this first paper in a series providing comprehensive insight into human kidney formation, we examined human kidney development in 135 anonymously donated human kidney specimens. We documented kidney development at a macroscopic and cellular level through histologic analysis, RNA in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence studies, and transcriptional profiling, contrasting human development (4-23 weeks) with mouse development at selected stages (embryonic day 15.5 and postnatal day 2). The high-resolution histologic interactive atlas of human kidney organogenesis generated can be viewed at the GUDMAP database (www.gudmap.org) together with three-dimensional reconstructions of key components of the data herein. At the anatomic level, human and mouse kidney development differ in timing, scale, and global features such as lobe formation and progenitor niche organization. The data also highlight differences in molecular and cellular features, including the expression and cellular distribution of anchor gene markers used to identify key cell types in mouse kidney studies. These data will facilitate and inform in vitro efforts to generate human kidney structures and comparative functional analyses across mammalian species.},

	abstract = {Cellular interactions among nephron, interstitial, and collecting duct progenitors drive mammalian kidney development. In mice, Six2+ nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) and Foxd1+ interstitial progenitor cells (IPCs) form largely distinct lineage compartments at the onset of metanephric kidney development. Here, we used the method for analyzing RNA following intracellular sorting (MARIS) approach, single-cell transcriptional profiling, in situ hybridization, and immunolabeling to characterize the presumptive NPC and IPC compartments of the developing human kidney. As in mice, each progenitor population adopts a stereotypical arrangement in the human nephron-forming niche: NPCs capped outgrowing ureteric branch tips, whereas IPCs were sandwiched between the NPCs and the renal capsule. Unlike mouse NPCs, human NPCs displayed a transcriptional profile that overlapped substantially with the IPC transcriptional profile, and key IPC determinants, including FOXD1, were readily detected within SIX2+ NPCs. Comparative gene expression profiling in human and mouse Six2/SIX2+ NPCs showed broad agreement between the species but also identified species-biased expression of some genes. Notably, some human NPC-enriched genes, including DAPL1 and COL9A2, are linked to human renal disease. We further explored the cellular diversity of mesenchymal cell types in the human nephrogenic niche through single-cell transcriptional profiling. Data analysis stratified NPCs into two main subpopulations and identified a third group of differentiating cells. These findings were confirmed by section in situ hybridization with novel human NPC markers predicted through the single-cell studies. This study provides a benchmark for the mesenchymal progenitors in the human nephrogenic niche and highlights species-variability in kidney developmental programs.},

We created protein localization maps that highlight the emerging patterns along the proximal–distal axis of the developing nephron and benchmark expectations for localization of functionally important transcription factors, which revealed unanticipated cellular diversity. Moreover, we identified a novel nephron subdomain marked by Wnt4 expression that we fate-mapped to the proximal mature nephron. Significant conservation was observed between human and mouse patterning. We also determined the time at which markers for mature nephron cell types first emerge—critical data for the renal organoid field. These findings have conceptual implications for the evolutionary processes driving the diversity of mammalian organ systems. Furthermore, these findings provide practical insights beyond those gained with mouse and rat models that will guide in vitro efforts to harness the developmental programs necessary to build human kidney structures.},

	abstract = {Asthma is the most prevalent chronic disease among pediatrics, as it is the leading cause of student absenteeism and hospitalization for those under the age of 15. To address the significant need to manage this disease in children, the authors present a mobile health (mHealth) system that determines the risk of an asthma attack through physiological and environmental wireless sensors and representational state transfer application program interfaces (RESTful APIs). The data is sent from wireless sensors to a smartwatch application (app) via a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant cryptography framework, which then sends data to a cloud for real-time analytics. The asthma risk is then sent to the smartwatch and provided to the user via simple graphics for easy interpretation by children. After testing the safety and feasibility of the system in an adult with moderate asthma prior to testing in children, it was found that the analytics model is able to determine the overall asthma risk (high, medium, or low risk) with an accuracy of 80.10±14.13\%. Furthermore, the features most important for assessing the risk of an asthma attack were multifaceted, highlighting the importance of continuously monitoring different wireless sensors and RESTful APIs. Future testing this asthma attack risk prediction system in pediatric asthma individuals may lead to an effective self-management asthma program.},

	abstract = {A prerequisite for single cell study is the capture and isolation of individual cells. In microfluidic devices, cell capture is often achieved by means of trapping. While many microfluidic trapping techniques exist, hydrodynamic methods are particularly attractive due to their simplicity and scalability. However, current design guidelines for single cell hydrodynamic traps predominantly rely on flow resistance manipulation or qualitative streamline analysis without considering the target particle size. This lack of quantitative design criteria from first principles often leads to non-optimal probabilistic trapping. In this work, we describe an analytical design guideline for deterministic single cell hydrodynamic trapping through the optimization of streamline distributions under laminar flow with cell size as a key parameter. Using this guideline, we demonstrate an example design which can achieve 100\% capture efficiency for a given particle size. Finite element modelling was used to determine the design parameters necessary for optimal trapping. The simulation results were subsequently confirmed with on-chip microbead and white blood cell trapping experiments.},

A key question is whether time or a patent vasculature is required for ongoing morphogenesis. Here, we show that hPSC-derived kidney organoids, derived in fully defined medium conditions and in the absence of any exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor, develop host-derived vascularization. In vivo imaging of organoids under the kidney capsule confirms functional glomerular perfusion as well as connection to pre-existing vascular networks in the organoids. Wide-field electron microscopy demonstrates that transplantation results in formation of a glomerular basement membrane, fenestrated endothelial cells, and podocyte foot processes. Furthermore, compared with non-transplanted organoids, polarization and segmental specialization of tubular epithelium are observed. These data demonstrate that functional vascularization is required for progressive morphogenesis of human kidney organoids.},

Despite recent advances, the process of transdifferentiation of CoRL to podocytes is poorly understood. In this study, we employed a transgenic reporter mouse line which permanently labels CoRL with ZsGreen fluorescent protein, allowing for isolation by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. At 5 days following induction of abrupt podocyte ablation via anti-podocyte sheep IgG, mice were sacrificed and CoRL were isolated by FACS. RNA was subsequently analyzed by microarray. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed and revealed that CoRL display a distinct phenotype following podocyte ablation, primarily consisting of downregulation of metabolic processes and upregulation of immuno-modulatory processes. Additionally, RNA-biology and cell cycle-related processes were also upregulated. Changes in gene expression or activity of a core set of transcription factors including HNF1 and E2F were identified through changes in enrichment of their respective target genes. However, integration of results from transcription factor and canonical pathway analysis indicated that ERR1 and PU-box family members may be the major contributors to the post-podocyte ablation phenotype of CoRL. Finally, top ranking genes were selected from the microarray-based analysis and confirmed by qPCR. Collectively, our results provide valuable insights into the transcriptional regulation of CoRL following abrupt podocyte ablation.},

The second generates novel mouse strains. In these strains, cell types of particular interest within an organ are labeled through the introduction of a specific marker into the context of a gene that exhibits appropriate cell type or structure-specific expression. In addition, the targeting construct enables genetic manipulation within the cell of interest in many of the strains.

Variation in cord number and structure demonstrates that cord specification is not stereotypic, although cord alignment and diameter becomes relatively consistent, implicating compensatory growth mechanisms. Branched, fused, and internalized cords were commonly observed. We conclude that the tubule-like structure of testis cords arise through a novel form of morphogenesis consisting of coalescence, partitioning, and remodeling.

Using dual section in situ hybridization (SISH)/immunohistochemistry (IHC) we have revealed distinct distal/proximal patterning of Notch, BMP and Wnt pathway components within the RV stage nephron. Quantitation of mitoses and Cyclin D1 expression indicated that cell proliferation was higher in the distal RV, reflecting the differential developmental programs of the proximal and distal populations. A small number of RV genes were also expressed in the early connecting segment of the nephron. Dual ISH/IHC combined with serial section immunofluorescence and 3D reconstruction revealed that fusion occurs between the late RV and adjacent ureteric tip via a process that involves loss of the intervening ureteric epithelial basement membrane and insertion of cells expressing RV markers into the ureteric tip. Using Six2-eGFPCre x R26R-lacZ mice, we demonstrate that these cells are derived from the cap mesenchyme and not the ureteric epithelium.

Our results demonstrate novel, stereotypic, spatially defined cellular sub-domains within the cap mesenchyme, which may, in part, reflect induction of nephron precursors.

To demonstrate the potential of this resource to implicate developmentally critical features, we focused on gene expression patterns and pathways in the sexually indeterminate, androgen-independent GT. GT expression patterns reinforced the proposed similarities between development of GT, limb, and craniofacial prominences. Comparison of spatial expression patterns predicted a network of Wnt7a-associated GT-enriched epithelial genes, including Gjb2, Dsc3, Krt5, and Sostdc1. Known from other contexts, these genes are associated with normal epidermal differentiation, with disruptions in Dsc3 and Gjb2 showing palmo-plantar keratoderma in the limb. We propose that this gene network contributes to normal foreskin, scrotum, and labial development.

Despite considerable temporal and spatial data on gene expression in mammalian kidney development, primarily in rodent species, there is a paucity of genes whose expression is absolutely specific to a given anatomical compartment and/or developmental stage, defined here as 'anchor' genes. We previously generated an atlas of gene expression in the developing mouse kidney using microarray analysis of anatomical compartments collected via laser capture microdissection. Here, this data is further analysed to identify anchor genes via stringent bioinformatic filtering followed by high resolution section in situ hybridisation performed on 200 transcripts selected as specific to one of 11 anatomical compartments within the midgestation mouse kidney. A total of 37 anchor genes were identified across 6 compartments with the early proximal tubule being the compartment richest in anchor genes. Analysis of minimal and evolutionarily conserved promoter regions of this set of 25 anchor genes identified enrichment of transcription factor binding sites for Hnf4a and Hnf1b, RbpJ (Notch signalling), PPARγ:RxRA and COUP-TF family transcription factors. This was reinforced by GO analyses which also identified these anchor genes as targets in processes including epithelial proliferation and proximal tubular function. As well as defining anchor genes, this large scale validation of gene expression identified a further 92 compartment-enriched genes able to subcompartmentalise key processes during murine renal organogenesis spatially or ontologically. This included a cohort of 13 ureteric epithelial genes revealing previously unappreciated compartmentalisation of the collecting duct system and a series of early tubule genes suggesting that segmentation into proximal tubule, loop of Henle and distal tubule does not occur until the onset of glomerular vascularisation. Overall, this study serves to illuminate previously ill-defined stages of patterning and will enable further refinement of the lineage relationships within mammalian kidney development.},

By examining the murine mesonephric expression of markers of distinct stages and regions of metanephric nephrons during tubule formation and patterning, we provide further evidence to support this common morphogenetic mechanism. Renal vesicle, early proximal and distal tubule, loop of Henle, and renal corpuscle genes were expressed by mesonephric tubules. Vip, Slc6a20b, and Slc18a1 were male-specific.

	abstract = {Development of the lower urogenital tract (LUT) is an intricate process. This complexity is evidenced during formation of the prostate from the fetal male urethra, which relies on androgenic signals and epithelial-mesenchymal interactions(1,2). Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for prostate development may reveal growth mechanisms that are inappropriately reawakened later in life to give rise to prostate diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. The developing LUT is anatomically complex. By the time prostatic budding begins on 16.5 days post conception (dpc), numerous cell types are present. Vasculature, nerves and smooth muscle reside within the mesenchymal stroma(3). This stroma surrounds a multilayered epithelium and gives rise to the fetal prostate through androgen receptor-dependent paracrine signals(4). The identity of the stromal androgen receptor-responsive genes required for prostate development and the mechanism by which prostate ductal epithelium forms in response to these genes is not fully understood. The ability to precisely identify cell types and localize expression of specific factors within them is imperative to further understand prostate development. In situ hybridization (ISH) allows for localization of mRNAs within a tissue. Thus, this method can be used to identify pattern and timing of expression of signaling molecules and their receptors, thereby elucidating potential prostate developmental regulators. Here, we describe a high throughput ISH technique to identify mRNA expression patterns in the fetal mouse LUT using vibrating microtome-cut sections. This method offers several advantages over other ISH protocols. Performing ISH on thin sections adhered to a slide is technically difficult; cryosections frequently have poor structural quality while both cryosections and paraffin sections often result in weak signal resolution. Performing ISH on whole mount tissues can result in probe trapping. In contrast, our high throughput technique utilizes thick-cut sections that reveal detailed tissue architecture. Modified microfuge tubes allow easy handling of sections during the ISH procedure. A maximum of 4 mRNA transcripts can be screened from a single 17.5dpc LUT with up to 24 mRNA transcripts detected in a single run, thereby reducing cost and maximizing efficiency. This method allows multiple treatment groups to be processed identically and as a single unit, thereby removing any bias for interpreting data. Most pertinently for prostate researchers, this method provides a spatial and temporal location of low and high abundance mRNA transcripts in the fetal mouse urethra that gives rise to the prostate ductal network.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-12-441},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND:
The developing mouse kidney is currently the best-characterized model of organogenesis at a transcriptional level. Detailed spatial maps have been generated for gene expression profiling combined with systematic in situ screening. These studies, however, fall short of capturing the transcriptional complexity arising from each locus due to the limited scope of microarray-based technology, which is largely based on "gene-centric" models.

RESULTS:
To address this, the polyadenylated RNA and microRNA transcriptomes of the 15.5 dpc mouse kidney were profiled using strand-specific RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) to a depth sufficient to complement spatial maps from pre-existing microarray datasets. The transcriptional complexity of RNAs arising from mouse RefSeq loci was catalogued; including 3568 alternatively spliced transcripts and 532 uncharacterized alternate 3' UTRs. Antisense expressions for 60\% of RefSeq genes was also detected including uncharacterized non-coding transcripts overlapping kidney progenitor markers, Six2 and Sall1, and were validated by section in situ hybridization. Analysis of genes known to be involved in kidney development, particularly during mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, showed an enrichment of non-coding antisense transcripts extended along protein-coding RNAs.

CONCLUSION:
The resulting resource further refines the transcriptomic cartography of kidney organogenesis by integrating deep RNA sequencing data with locus-based information from previously published expression atlases. The added resolution of RNA-Seq has provided the basis for a transition from classical gene-centric models of kidney development towards more accurate and detailed "transcript-centric" representations, which highlights the extent of transcriptional complexity of genes that direct complex development events.},

The podocyte is a remarkable cell type, which encases the capillaries of the kidney glomerulus. Although mesodermal in origin it sends out axonal like projections that wrap around the capillaries. These extend yet finer projections, the foot processes, which interdigitate, leaving between them the slit diaphragms, through which the glomerular filtrate must pass. The podocytes are a subject of keen interest because of their key roles in kidney development and disease.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
In this report we identified and characterized a novel transgenic mouse line, MafB-GFP, which specifically marked the kidney podocytes from a very early stage of development. These mice were then used to facilitate the fluorescent activated cell sorting based purification of podocytes from embryos at E13.5 and E15.5, as well as adults. Microarrays were then used to globally define the gene expression states of podocytes at these different developmental stages. A remarkable picture emerged, identifying the multiple sets of genes that establish the neuronal, muscle, and phagocytic properties of podocytes. The complete combinatorial code of transcription factors that create the podocyte was characterized, and the global lists of growth factors and receptors they express were defined.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
The complete molecular character of the in vivo podocyte is established for the first time. The active molecular functions and biological processes further define their unique combination of features. The results provide a resource atlas of gene expression patterns of developing and adult podocytes that will help to guide further research of these incredible cells.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00467-010-1750-4},
	abstract = {It has long been appreciated that the mammalian kidney arises via reciprocal interactions between an epithelial ureteric epithelium and the surrounding metanephric mesenchyme. More recently, lineage tracing has confirmed that the portion of the metanephric mesenchyme closest to the advancing ureteric tips, the cap mesenchyme, represents the progenitor population for the nephron epithelia. This Six2(+)Cited1(+) population undergoes self-renewal throughout nephrogenesis while retaining the potential to epithelialize. In contrast, the Foxd1(+) portion of the metanephric mesenchyme shows no epithelial potential, developing instead into the interstitial, perivascular, and possibly endothelial elements of the kidney. The cap mesenchyme rests within a nephrogenic niche, surrounded by the stroma and the ureteric tip. While the role of Wnt signaling in nephron induction is known, there remains a lack of clarity over the intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of cap mesenchyme specification, self-renewal, and nephron potential. It is also not known what regulates cessation of nephrogenesis, but there is no nephron generation in response to injury during the postnatal period. In this review, we will examine what is and is not known about this nephron progenitor population and discuss how an increased understanding of the regulation of this population may better explain the observed variation in final nephron number and potentially facilitate the reinitiation or prolongation of nephron formation.},

	abstract = {Nephron number in the mammalian kidney is known to vary dramatically, with postnatal renal function directly influenced by nephron complement. What determines final nephron number is poorly understood but nephron formation in the mouse kidney ceases within the first few days after birth, presumably due to the loss of all remaining nephron progenitors via epithelial differentiation. What initiates this event is not known. Indeed, whether nephron formation occurs in the same way at this time as during embryonic development has also not been examined. In this study, we investigate the key cellular compartments involved in nephron formation; the ureteric tip, cap mesenchyme and early nephrons; from postnatal day (P) 0 to 6 in the mouse. High resolution analyses of gene and protein expression indicate that loss of nephron progenitors precedes loss of ureteric tip identity, but show spatial shifts in the expression of cap mesenchyme genes during this time. In addition, cap mesenchymal volume and rate of proliferation decline prior to birth. Section-based 3D modeling and Optical Projection Tomography revealed a burst of ectopic nephron induction, with the formation of multiple (up to 5) nephrons per ureteric tip evident from P2. While the distal-proximal patterning of these nephrons occurred normally, their spatial relationship with the ureteric compartment was altered. We propose that this phase of nephron formation represents an acceleration of differentiation within the cap mesenchyme due to a displacement of signals within the nephrogenic niche.},

	volume = {66},
	doi = {10.3791/4188},
	abstract = {During development neural crest (NC)-derived neuronal progenitors migrate away from the neural tube to form autonomic ganglia in visceral organs like the intestine and lower urinary tract. Both during development and in mature tissues these cells are often widely dispersed throughout tissues so that isolation of discrete populations using methods like laser capture micro-dissection is difficult. They can however be directly visualized by expression of fluorescent reporters driven from regulatory regions of neuron-specific genes like Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). We describe a method optimized for high yields of viable TH+ neuronal progenitors from fetal mouse visceral tissues, including intestine and lower urogenital tract (LUT), based on dissociation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The Th gene encodes the rate-limiting enzyme for production of catecholamines. Enteric neuronal progenitors begin to express TH during their migration in the fetal intestine and TH is also present in a subset of adult pelvic ganglia neurons . The first appearance of this lineage and the distribution of these neurons in other aspects of the LUT, and their isolation has not been described. Neuronal progenitors expressing TH can be readily visualized by expression of EGFP in mice carrying the transgene construct Tg(Th-EGFP)DJ76Gsat/Mmnc. We imaged expression of this transgene in fetal mice to document the distribution of TH+ cells in the developing LUT at 15.5 days post coitus (dpc), designating the morning of plug detection as 0.5 dpc, and observed that a subset of neuronal progenitors in the coalescing pelvic ganglia express EGFP. To isolate LUT TH+ neuronal progenitors, we optimized methods that were initially used to purify neural crest stem cells from fetal mouse intestine. Prior efforts to isolate NC-derived populations relied upon digestion with a cocktail of collagenase and trypsin to obtain cell suspensions for flow cytometry. In our hands these methods produced cell suspensions from the LUT with relatively low viability. Given the already low incidence of neuronal progenitors in fetal LUT tissues, we set out to optimize dissociation methods such that cell survival in the final dissociates would be increased. We determined that gentle dissociation in Accumax (Innovative Cell Technologies, Inc), manual filtering, and flow sorting at low pressures allowed us to achieve consistently greater survival ({\textgreater}70\% of total cells) with subsequent yields of neuronal progenitors sufficient for downstream analysis. The method we describe can be broadly applied to isolate a variety of neuronal populations from either fetal or adult murine tissues.},

To refine animal usage in prostate development studies, we also determined whether a comparable number of prostatic buds were formed in male and female mouse urogenital sinus (UGS) explants grown in vitro in the presence of androgen. We used IHC to label UGS epithelium and ISH to label prostatic buds with one of three different prostatic bud marking riboprobes: a previously identified prostatic bud marker, NK-3 transcription factor, locus 1 (Nkx3-1), and two newly identified prostatic bud markers, wingless-related MMTV integration site 10b (Wnt10b) and ectodysplasin-A receptor (Edar). We calculated total buds formed per UGS and the proportion marked by each mRNA after male UGS development in vivo and male and female UGS development in vitro. Nkx3-1 was first to mark the prostate field during UGS development in vivo but all three mRNAs marked prostatic buds during later developmental stages. The mRNAs localized to different domains: Nkx3-1 was present along about half the prostatic bud length while Edar and Wnt10b were restricted to distal bud tips. None of the mRNAs marked all buds formed in vitro and the proportion marked was developmental stage- and gender-dependent. Nkx3-1 marked the highest proportion of prostatic buds during in vitro UGS development. Together, our results reveal that ISH staining of mouse UGS can be used to quantify prostatic bud number, Nkx3-1 is currently the best suited riboprobe for this method, and female UGSs cannot be used interchangeably with male UGSs when conducting prostate development studies in vitro. We also found that Nkx3-1, Edar, and Wnt10b mark different prostatic bud regions and are likely to be useful in future studies of regional differences in prostatic bud gene expression.},

However the spatial organization of developing innervation in the murine urogenital tract (UGT) and the gene networks that regulate specification and maturation of neurons within the pelvic ganglia of the lower urinary tract (LUT) are unknown. We used whole-mount immunohistochemistry and histochemical stains to localize neural elements in 15.5 days post coitus (dpc) fetal mice. To identify potential regulatory factors expressed in pelvic ganglia, we surveyed expression patterns for known or probable transcription factors (TF) annotated in the mouse genome by screening a whole-mount in situ hybridization library of fetal UGTs. Of the 155 genes detected in pelvic ganglia, 88 encode TFs based on the presence of predicted DNA-binding domains. Neural crest (NC)-derived progenitors within the LUT were labeled by Sox10, a well-known regulator of NC development. Genes identified were categorized based on patterns of restricted expression in pelvic ganglia, pelvic ganglia and urethral epithelium, or pelvic ganglia and urethral mesenchyme. Gene expression patterns and the distribution of Sox10+, Phox2b+, Hu+, and PGP9.5+ cells within developing ganglia suggest previously unrecognized regional segregation of Sox10+ progenitors and differentiating neurons in early development of pelvic ganglia. Reverse transcription-PCR of pelvic ganglia RNA from fetal and post-natal stages demonstrated that multiple TFs maintain post-natal expression, although Pax3 is extinguished before weaning. Our analysis identifies multiple potential regulatory genes including TFs that may participate in segregation of discrete lineages within pelvic ganglia. The genes identified here are attractive candidate disease genes that may now be further investigated for their roles in malformation syndromes or in LUT dysfunction.},

The gonad is an ideal place to study this process, because it originates as a bipotential primordium where multiple distinct lineages acquire sex-specific fates as the organ differentiates as a testis or an ovary. To gain a more detailed understanding of the process of gonadal differentiation at the level of the individual cell populations, we conducted microarrays on sorted cells from XX and XY mouse gonads at three time points spanning the period when the gonadal cells transition from sexually undifferentiated progenitors to their respective sex-specific fates. We analyzed supporting cells, interstitial/stromal cells, germ cells, and endothelial cells. This work identified genes specifically depleted and enriched in each lineage as it underwent sex-specific differentiation. We determined that the sexually undifferentiated germ cell and supporting cell progenitors showed lineage priming. We found that germ cell progenitors were primed with a bias toward the male fate. In contrast, supporting cells were primed with a female bias, indicative of the robust repression program involved in the commitment to XY supporting cell fate. This study provides a molecular explanation reconciling the female default and balanced models of sex determination and represents a rich resource for the field. More importantly, it yields new insights into the mechanisms by which different cell types in a single organ adopt their respective fates.},

Despite growing awareness of sexually dimorphic gene expression in the UGS, we are still limited in our knowledge of androgen-responsive genes in UGM that initiate prostate ductal development. We found that WNT inhibitory factor 1 (Wif1) mRNA is more abundant in male vs. female mouse UGM in which its expression temporally and spatially overlaps androgen-responsive steroid 5α-reductase 2 (Srd5a2). Wif1 mRNA is also present in prostatic buds during their elongation and branching morphogenesis. Androgens are necessary and sufficient for Wif1 expression in mouse UGS explant mesenchyme, and testicular androgens remain necessary for normal Wif1 expression in adult mouse prostate stroma. WIF1 contributes functionally to prostatic bud formation. In the presence of androgens, exogenous WIF1 protein increases prostatic bud number and UGS basal epithelial cell proliferation without noticeably altering the pattern of WNT/β-catenin-responsive Axin2 or lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (Lef1) mRNA. Wif1 mutant male UGSs exhibit increased (Sfrp)2 and (Sfrp)3 expression and form the same number of prostatic buds as the wild-type control males. Collectively our results reveal Wif1 as one of the few known androgen-responsive genes in the fetal mouse UGM and support the hypothesis that androgen-dependent Wif1 expression is linked to the mechanism of androgen-induced prostatic bud formation.},

This review addresses significant changes in our understanding of urothelial development and regeneration. Understanding urothelial differentiation will be important in the push to find new methods of bladder reconstruction and augmentation, as well as identification of bladder cancer stem cells.

RECENT FINDINGS:
This review will cover recent findings including the identification of novel progenitor cells in the embryo and adult urothelium, function of the urothelium, and regeneration of the urothelium. Using Cre-lox recombination with cell-type-specific Cre lines, lineage studies from our laboratory have revealed novel urothelial cell types and progenitors that are critical for formation and regeneration of the urothelium. Interestingly, our studies indicate that Keratin-5-expressing basal cells, which have previously been proposed to be urothelial stem cells, are a self-renewing unipotent population, whereas P-cells, a novel urothelial cell type, are progenitors in the embryo, and intermediate cells serve as a progenitor pool in the adult.

SUMMARY:
These findings could have important implications for our understanding of cancer tumorigenesis and could move the fields of regeneration and reconstruction forward.},

	abstract = {The mammalian kidney has an intrinsic ability to repair after significant injury. However, this process is inefficient: patients are at high risk for the loss of kidney function in later life. No therapy exists to treat established acute kidney injury (AKI) per se: strategies to promote endogenous repair processes and retard associated fibrosis are a high priority. Whole-organ gene expression profiling has been used to identify repair responses initiated with AKI, and factors that may promote the transition from AKI to chronic kidney disease. Transcriptional profiling has shown molecular markers and potential regulatory pathways of renal repair. Activation of a few key developmental pathways has been reported during repair. Whether these are comparable networks with similar target genes with those in earlier nephrogenesis remains unclear. Altered microRNA profiles, persistent tubular injury responses, and distinct late inflammatory responses highlight continuing kidney pathology. Additional insights into injury and repair processes will be gained by study of the repair transcriptome and cell-specific translatome using high-resolution technologies such as RNA sequencing and translational profiling tailored to specific cellular compartments within the kidney. An enhanced understanding holds promise for both the identification of novel therapeutic targets and biomarker-based evaluation of the damage-repair process.},

The molecular mechanisms of external genital development are beginning to be identified; however, the origin of cells that give rise to external genitalia is unknown. Here we use cell lineage analysis to show that the genital tubercle, the precursor of the penis and clitoris, arises from two populations of progenitor cells that originate at the lateral edges of the embryo, at the level of the posterior hindlimb buds and anterior tail. During body wall closure, the left and right external genital progenitor pools are brought together at the ventral midline, where they form the paired genital swellings that give rise to the genital tubercle. Unexpectedly, the left and right external genital progenitor pools form two lineage-restricted compartments in the phallus. Together with previous lineage studies of limb buds, our results indicate that, at the pelvic level, the early lateral mesoderm is regionalized from medial to lateral into dorsal limb, ventral limb, and external genital progenitor fields. These findings have implications for the evolutionary diversification of external genitalia and for the association between external genital defects and disruption of body wall closure, as seen in the epispadias-extrophy complex.},

	abstract = {The functional unit of the mammalian metanephric kidney is the nephron: a complex tubular structure dedicated to blood filtration and maintenance of several important physiological functions. Nephrons are assembled from a nephron-restricted pool of mesenchymal progenitors over an extensive developmental period that is completed prior to (human), or shortly after (mouse), birth. An appropriate balance in the expansion and commitment of nephron progenitors to nephron formation is essential for normal kidney function. Too few nephrons increase risk of kidney disease later in life while the failure of normal progenitor differentiation in Wilm's tumor patients leads to massive growth of a nephroblast population often necessitating surgical removal of the kidney. An inductive process within the metanephric mesenchyme leads to the formation of a pretubular aggregate which transitions into an epithelial renal vesicle: the precursor for nephron assembly. Growth, morphogenesis and patterning transform this simple cyst-like structure into a highly elongated mature nephron with distinct cell types positioned along a proximal (glomerular) to distal (connecting segment) axis of functional organization. This review discusses our current understanding of the specification, maintenance and commitment of nephron progenitors, and the regulatory processes that transform the renal vesicle into a nephron.},

We previously developed an anatomical ontology for the murine urogenital system. Here, we present a comprehensive update of this ontology pertaining to mouse LUT, genital tubercle and associated reproductive structures (E10.5 to adult). Ontology changes were based on recently published insights into the cellular and gross anatomy of these structures, and on new analyses of epithelial cell types present in the pelvic urethra and regions of the bladder. Ontology changes include new structures, tissue layers and cell types within the LUT, external genitalia and lower reproductive structures. Representative illustrations, detailed text descriptions and molecular markers that selectively label muscle, nerves/ganglia and epithelia of the lower urogenital system are also presented. The revised ontology will be an important tool for researchers studying urogenital development/malformation in mouse models and will improve our capacity to appropriately interpret these with respect to the human situation.},

The nAChR subtype transduces the irritant effects of nicotine in tobacco smoke and, in certain brain areas, may be involved in nicotine addiction and/or withdrawal. Menthol, a widely used additive in cigarettes, is a potential analgesic and/or counterirritant at sensory nerves and may also influence nicotine's actions in the brain. We examined menthol's effects on recombinant human α3β4 nAChRs and native nAChRs in mouse sensory neurons. Menthol markedly decreased nAChR activity as assessed by Ca(2+) imaging, (86)Rb(+) efflux, and voltage-clamp measurements. Coapplication of menthol with acetylcholine or nicotine increased desensitization, demonstrated by an increase in the rate and magnitude of the current decay and a reduction of the current integral. These effects increased with agonist concentration. Pretreatment with menthol followed by its washout did not affect agonist-induced desensitization, suggesting that menthol must be present during the application of agonist to augment desensitization. Notably, menthol acted in a voltage-independent manner and reduced the mean open time of single channels without affecting their conductance, arguing against a simple channel-blocking effect. Further, menthol slowed or prevented the recovery of nAChRs from desensitization, indicating that it probably stabilizes a desensitized state. Moreover, menthol at concentrations up to 1 mM did not compete for the orthosteric nAChR binding site labeled by [(3)H]epibatidine. Taken together, these data indicate that menthol promotes desensitization of α3β4 nAChRs by an allosteric action.},

The goal of this short review is to use the urinary bladder as an example to stimulate interest in this question. The bladder requires a healthy mature nervous system to store urine and release it at behaviorally appropriate times. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the construction of these neural circuits is not only relevant to defining the basis of developmental problems but may also suggest strategies to restore connectivity and function following injury or disease in adults. The bladder nerve supply comprises multiple classes of sensory, and parasympathetic or sympathetic autonomic effector (motor) neurons. First, we define the developmental endpoint by describing this circuitry in adult rodents. Next we discuss the innervation of the developing bladder, identifying challenges posed by this area of research. Last we provide examples of genetically modified mice with bladder dysfunction and suggest potential neural contributors to this state.},

	abstract = {Nephron endowment is determined by the self-renewal and induction of a nephron progenitor pool established at the onset of kidney development. In the mouse, the related transcriptional regulators Six1 and Six2 play non-overlapping roles in nephron progenitors. Transient Six1 activity prefigures, and is essential for, active nephrogenesis. By contrast, Six2 maintains later progenitor self-renewal from the onset of nephrogenesis. We compared the regulatory actions of Six2 in mouse and human nephron progenitors by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq). Surprisingly, SIX1 was identified as a SIX2 target unique to the human nephron progenitors. Furthermore, RNA-seq and immunostaining revealed overlapping SIX1 and SIX2 activity in 16 week human fetal nephron progenitors. Comparative bioinformatic analysis of human SIX1 and SIX2 ChIP-seq showed each factor targeted a similar set of cis-regulatory modules binding an identical target recognition motif. In contrast to the mouse where Six2 binds its own enhancers but does not interact with DNA around Six1, both human SIX1 and SIX2 bind homologous SIX2 enhancers and putative enhancers positioned around SIX1. Transgenic analysis of a putative human SIX1 enhancer in the mouse revealed a transient, mouse-like, pre-nephrogenic, Six1 regulatory pattern. Together, these data demonstrate a divergence in SIX-factor regulation between mouse and human nephron progenitors. In the human, an auto/cross-regulatory loop drives continued SIX1 and SIX2 expression during active nephrogenesis. By contrast, the mouse establishes only an auto-regulatory Six2 loop. These data suggest differential SIX-factor regulation might have contributed to species differences in nephron progenitor programs such as the duration of nephrogenesis and the final nephron count.},

Individual organoids generated within the same differentiation experiment show Spearmans correlation coefficients of {\textgreater}0.99. The greatest source of variation was seen between experimental batch, with the enrichment for genes that also varied temporally between day 10 and day 25 organoids implicating nephron maturation as contributing to transcriptional variance between individual differentiation experiments. A morphological analysis revealed a transition from renal vesicle to capillary loop stage nephrons across the same time period. Distinct iPSC clones were also shown to display congruent transcriptional programs with inter-experimental and inter-clonal variation most strongly associated with nephron patterning. Even epithelial cells isolated from organoids showed transcriptional alignment with total organoids of the same day of differentiation.

In order to improve our resolution of individual cell transcriptional profiles during kidney morphogenesis, we have performed 10x Chromium single cell RNA-seq on over 6000 cells from the E18.5 developing mouse kidney, as well as more than 7000 cells from human iPSC-derived kidney organoids. We identified 16 clusters of cells representing all major cell lineages in the E18.5 mouse kidney. The differentially expressed genes from individual murine clusters were then used to guide the classification of 16 cell clusters within human kidney organoids, revealing the presence of distinguishable stromal, endothelial, nephron, podocyte and nephron progenitor populations. Despite the congruence between developing mouse and human organoid, our analysis suggested limited nephron maturation and the presence of off target populations in human kidney organoids, including unidentified stromal populations and evidence of neural clusters. This may reflect unique human kidney populations, mixed cultures or aberrant differentiation in vitro. Analysis of clusters within the mouse data revealed novel insights into progenitor maintenance and cellular maturation in the major renal lineages and will serve as a roadmap to refine directed differentiation approaches in human iPSC-derived kidney organoids.},

The implications of these findings for the directed differentiation of hPSCs into the kidney include the mechanism of the intermediate mesoderm specification and its patterning along with anteroposterior axis. Using this knowledge, we previously reported successful generation of hPSCs-derived kidney organoids that contained all renal components and modelled human kidney development in vitro.

	abstract = {Precise measurement of cellularity within bioartificial tissues and extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds is necessary to augment rigorous characterization of cellular behavior, as accurate benchmarking of tissue function to cell number allows for comparison of data across experiments and between laboratories. Resazurin, a soluble dye that is reduced to highly fluorescent resorufin in proportion to the metabolic activity of a cell population, is a valuable, noninvasive tool to measure cell number. We investigated experimental conditions in which resazurin reduction is a reliable indicator of cellularity within three-dimensional (3D) ECM scaffolds. Using three renal cell populations, we demonstrate that correlation of viable cell numbers with the rate of resorufin generation may deviate from linearity at higher cell densities, lower resazurin working volumes, or longer incubation times that all contribute to depleting the pool of resazurin. In conclusion, while the resazurin reduction assay provides a powerful, noninvasive readout of metrics enumerating cellularity and growth within ECM scaffolds, assay conditions may strongly influence its applicability for accurate quantification of cell number.

	abstract = {The development of the mammalian kidney is well conserved from mouse to man. Despite considerable temporal and spatial data on gene expression in mammalian kidney development, primarily in rodent species, there is a paucity of genes whose expression is absolutely specific to a given anatomical compartment and/or developmental stage, defined here as 'anchor' genes. We previously generated an atlas of gene expression in the developing mouse kidney using microarray analysis of anatomical compartments collected via laser capture microdissection. Here, this data is further analysed to identify anchor genes via stringent bioinformatic filtering followed by high resolution section in situ hybridisation performed on 200 transcripts selected as specific to one of 11 anatomical compartments within the midgestation mouse kidney. A total of 37 anchor genes were identified across 6 compartments with the early proximal tubule being the compartment richest in anchor genes. Analysis of minimal and evolutionarily conserved promoter regions of this set of 25 anchor genes identified enrichment of transcription factor binding sites for Hnf4a and Hnf1b, RbpJ (Notch signalling), PPARγ:RxRA and COUP-TF family transcription factors. This was reinforced by GO analyses which also identified these anchor genes as targets in processes including epithelial proliferation and proximal tubular function. As well as defining anchor genes, this large scale validation of gene expression identified a further 92 compartment-enriched genes able to subcompartmentalise key processes during murine renal organogenesis spatially or ontologically. This included a cohort of 13 ureteric epithelial genes revealing previously unappreciated compartmentalisation of the collecting duct system and a series of early tubule genes suggesting that segmentation into proximal tubule, loop of Henle and distal tubule does not occur until the onset of glomerular vascularisation. Overall, this study serves to illuminate previously ill-defined stages of patterning and will enable further refinement of the lineage relationships within mammalian kidney development.},

	abstract = {Congenital anomalies of the kidney and the urinary tract (CAKUT) represent a major source of morbidity and mortality in children. Several factors (PAX, SOX,WNT, RET, GDFN, and others) play critical roles during the differentiation process that leads to the formation of nephron epithelia. We have identified mutations in SOX17, an HMG-box transcription factor and Wnt signaling antagonist, in eight patients with CAKUT (seven vesico-ureteric reflux, one pelvic obstruction). One mutation, c.775T{\textgreater}A (p.Y259N), recurred in six patients. Four cases derived from two small families; renal scars with urinary infection represented the main symptom at presentation in all but two patients. Transfection studies indicated a 5-10-fold increase in the levels of the mutant protein relative to wild-type SOX17 in transfected kidney cells. Moreover we observed a corresponding increase in the ability of SOX17 p.Y259N to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional activity, which is known to regulate multiple stages of kidney and urinary tract development. In conclusion, SOX17 p.Y259N mutation is recurrent in patients with CAKUT. Our data shows that this mutation correlates with an inappropriate accumulation of SOX17-p.Y259N protein and inhibition of the β-catenin/Wnt signaling pathway. These data indicate a role of SOX17 in human kidney and urinary tract development and implicate the SOX17-p.Y259N mutation as a causative factor in CAKUT.},

CALUT includes ureteral anomaliesc such as congenital abnormalities of the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) and ureterovesical junction (UVJ), and birth defects of the bladder and the urethra such as bladder-exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC), prune belly syndrome (PBS), and posterior urethral valves (PUVs). CALUT is one of the most common birth defects and is often associated with antenatal hydronephrosis, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), urinary tract obstruction, urinary tract infections (UTI), chronic kidney disease, and renal failure in children. Here, we discuss the current genetic and molecular knowledge about lower urinary tract development and genetic basis of CALUT in both human and mouse models. We provide an overview of the developmental processes leading to the formation of the ureter, the bladder, and the urethra, and different genes and signaling pathways controlling these developmental processes. Human genetic disorders that affect the ureter, the bladder and the urethra and associated gene mutations are also presented. As we are entering the postgenomic era of personalized medicine, information in this article may provide useful interpretation for the genetic and genomic test results collected from patients with lower urinary tract birth defects. With evidence-based interpretations, clinicians may provide more effective personalized therapies to patients and genetic counseling for their families.},

Here, we use a novel fluorescence-based three-dimensional modeling approach to show that cords initially form as a network of irregular cell clusters that are subsequently remodeled to form regular parallel loops, joined by a flattened plexus at the mesonephric side. Variation in cord number and structure demonstrates that cord specification is not stereotypic, although cord alignment and diameter becomes relatively consistent, implicating compensatory growth mechanisms. Branched, fused, and internalized cords were commonly observed. We conclude that the tubule-like structure of testis cords arise through a novel form of morphogenesis consisting of coalescence, partitioning, and remodeling. The methods we describe are applicable to investigating defects in testis cord development in mouse models, and more broadly, studying morphogenesis of other tissues.},

	abstract = {Several Wnt proteins are expressed in the embryonic kidney during various stages of development. Gene knockout models and ex vivo studies have provided strong evidence that Wnt-mediated signals are essential in renal ontogeny. Perhaps the most critical factors, Wnt9b and Wnt4, function during the early phase when the cap mesenchyme is induced to undergo morphogenesis into a nephron. Wnt11 controls early ureteric bud branching and contributes to the final kidney size. In addition to its inductive role, later on Wnt9b plays a significant role in the convergent extension of the tubular epithelial cells, while Wnt4 signaling controls smooth muscle cell fates in the medulla. Wnt7b has a specific function together with its likely antagonist Dkk1 in controlling the morphogenesis of the renal medulla. The signal-transduction mechanisms of the Wnts in kidney ontogeny have not been resolved, but studies characterizing the downstream signaling pathways are emerging. Aberrant Wnt signaling may lead to kidney diseases ranging from fatal kidney agenesis to more benign phenotypes. Wnt-mediated signaling regulates several critical aspects of kidney development from the early inductive stages to later steps of tubular epithelial maturation.},

In genetically mosaic mouse ureteric buds, competition between phenotypically mutant Fz4(-/-) or Fz4(-/-);Fz8(-/-) cells and adjacent phenotypically wild-type Fz4(+/-) or Fz4(+/-);Fz8(-/-) cells results in under-representation of the mutant cells to an extent far greater than would be predicted from the size reduction of homogeneously mutant kidneys. This discrepancy presumably reflects the compensatory action of a network of growth regulatory systems that minimize developmental perturbations. The present work represents the first description of a kidney phenotype referable to one or more Wnt receptors and demonstrates a general strategy for revealing the contribution of an individual growth regulatory pathway when it is part of a larger homeostatic network.},

	abstract = {Primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the most common congenital anomaly of the kidney and the urinary tract, and it is a major risk factor for pyelonephritic scarring and CKD in children. Although twin studies support the heritability of VUR, specific genetic causes remain elusive. We performed a sequential genome-wide linkage study and whole-exome sequencing in a family with hereditary VUR. We obtained a significant multipoint parametric logarithm of odds score of 3.3 on chromosome 6p, and whole-exome sequencing identified a deleterious heterozygous mutation (T3257I) in the gene encoding tenascin XB (TNXB in 6p21.3). This mutation segregated with disease in the affected family as well as with a pathogenic G1331R change in another family. Fibroblast cell lines carrying the T3257I mutation exhibited a reduction in both cell motility and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase expression, suggesting a defect in the focal adhesions that link the cell cytoplasm to the extracellular matrix. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the human uroepithelial lining of the ureterovesical junction expresses TNXB, suggesting that TNXB may be important for generating tensile forces that close the ureterovesical junction during voiding. Taken together, these results suggest that mutations in TNXB can cause hereditary VUR.},

Urinary incontinence is one of the most common lower urinary tract disorders in adults, but especially in the elderly female. The urethra, its sphincters, and the pelvic floor are key structures in the achievement of continence, but their basic anatomy is little known and, to some extent, still incompletely understood. Because questions with respect to continence arise from human morbidity, but are often investigated in rodent animal models, we present findings in human and rodent anatomy and histology. Differences between males and females in the role that the pelvic floor plays in the maintenance of continence are described. Furthermore, we briefly describe the embryologic origin of ureters, bladder, and urethra, because the developmental origin of structures such as the vesicoureteral junction, the bladder trigone, and the penile urethra are often invoked to explain (clinical) observations. As the human pelvic floor has acquired features in evolution that are typical for a species with bipedal movement, we also compare the pelvic floor of humans with that of rodents to better understand the rodent (or any other quadruped, for that matter) as an experimental model species. The general conclusion is that the "Bauplan" is well conserved, even though its common features are sometimes difficult to discern.},

	abstract = {The mammalian kidney forms via cell-cell interactions between an epithelial outgrowth of the nephric duct and the surrounding nephrogenic mesenchyme. Initial morphogenetic events include ureteric bud branching to form the collecting duct (CD) tree and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transitions to form the nephrons, requiring reciprocal induction between adjacent mesenchyme and epithelial cells. Within the tips of the branching ureteric epithelium, cells respond to mesenchyme-derived trophic factors by proliferation, migration, and mitosis-associated cell dispersal. Self-inhibition signals from one tip to another play a role in branch patterning. The position, survival, and fate of the nephrogenic mesenchyme are regulated by ECM and secreted signals from adjacent tip and stroma. Signals from the ureteric tip promote mesenchyme self-renewal and trigger nephron formation. Subsequent fusion to the CDs, nephron segmentation and maturation, and formation of a patent glomerular basement membrane also require specialized cell-cell interactions. Differential cadherin, laminin, nectin, and integrin expression, as well as intracellular kinesin and actin-mediated regulation of cell shape and adhesion, underlies these cell-cell interactions. Indeed, the capacity for the kidney to form via self-organization has now been established both via the recapitulation of expected morphogenetic interactions after complete dissociation and reassociation of cellular components during development as well as the in vitro formation of 3D kidney organoids from human pluripotent stem cells. As we understand more about how the many cell-cell interactions required for kidney formation operate, this enables the prospect of bioengineering replacement structures based on these self-organizing properties.},

In the mouse, directional looping of the heart and rotation of the embryo, the first overt evidence of left/right asymmetry (L/R), are observed at early somite stages ( approximately E8.5) [1, 2]. Activation of a Nodal-Pitx2 regulatory pathway specifically within the left lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) is critical for these events [3-10]. Asymmetric expression of Nodal is thought to be triggered by left-oriented, cilia-generated flow within the ventral, midline node [11, 12]. Genetic removal of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in the mouse demonstrates a requirement for Hedgehog signals in the symmetry-breaking process [13], and analysis of node trafficking has suggested a mechanism of directional transport in the node that might relate to symmetry breaking in the LPM [14]. Here we provide evidence that Hedgehog signaling in the node is not essential for breaking bilateral symmetry. In contrast, direct Hh signaling in the LPM is critical. Evidence is presented that Sonic and Indian hedgehog signals act together, through a Foxf1/Bmp4 pathway, to enable the initiation and propagation of Nodal signaling within the LPM, regulating the competence of that tissue to respond to the Nodal pathway.},

Development of new biomarkers and therapies for CKD will be aided by a detailed analysis of myofibroblast gene expression during the early stages of fibrosis. However, dissociating myofibroblasts from fibrotic kidney is challenging. We therefore adapted translational ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) to isolate and profile mRNA from myofibroblasts and their precursors during kidney fibrosis. We generated and characterized a transgenic mouse expressing an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-tagged L10a ribosomal subunit protein under control of the collagen1α1 promoter. We developed a one-step procedure for isolation of polysomal RNA from collagen1α1-eGFPL10a mice subject to unilateral ureteral obstruction and analyzed and validated the resulting transcriptional profiles. Pathway analysis revealed strong gene signatures for cell proliferation, migration, and shape change. Numerous novel genes and candidate biomarkers were upregulated during fibrosis, specifically in myofibroblasts, and we validated these results by quantitative PCR, in situ, and Western blot analysis. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of early myofibroblast gene expression during kidney fibrosis and introduces a new technique for cell-specific polysomal mRNA isolation in kidney injury models that is suited for RNA-sequencing technologies.},

In mice, Six2+ nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) and Foxd1+ interstitial progenitor cells (IPCs) form largely distinct lineage compartments at the onset of metanephric kidney development. Here, we used the method for analyzing RNA following intracellular sorting (MARIS) approach, single-cell transcriptional profiling, in situ hybridization, and immunolabeling to characterize the presumptive NPC and IPC compartments of the developing human kidney. As in mice, each progenitor population adopts a stereotypical arrangement in the human nephron-forming niche: NPCs capped outgrowing ureteric branch tips, whereas IPCs were sandwiched between the NPCs and the renal capsule. Unlike mouse NPCs, human NPCs displayed a transcriptional profile that overlapped substantially with the IPC transcriptional profile, and key IPC determinants, including FOXD1, were readily detected within SIX2+ NPCs. Comparative gene expression profiling in human and mouse Six2/SIX2+ NPCs showed broad agreement between the species but also identified species-biased expression of some genes. Notably, some human NPC-enriched genes, including DAPL1 and COL9A2, are linked to human renal disease. We further explored the cellular diversity of mesenchymal cell types in the human nephrogenic niche through single-cell transcriptional profiling. Data analysis stratified NPCs into two main subpopulations and identified a third group of differentiating cells. These findings were confirmed by section in situ hybridization with novel human NPC markers predicted through the single-cell studies.

Nephrons are assembled from a nephron-restricted pool of mesenchymal progenitors over an extensive developmental period that is completed prior to (human), or shortly after (mouse), birth. An appropriate balance in the expansion and commitment of nephron progenitors to nephron formation is essential for normal kidney function. Too few nephrons increase risk of kidney disease later in life while the failure of normal progenitor differentiation in Wilm's tumor patients leads to massive growth of a nephroblast population often necessitating surgical removal of the kidney. An inductive process within the metanephric mesenchyme leads to the formation of a pretubular aggregate which transitions into an epithelial renal vesicle: the precursor for nephron assembly. Growth, morphogenesis and patterning transform this simple cyst-like structure into a highly elongated mature nephron with distinct cell types positioned along a proximal (glomerular) to distal (connecting segment) axis of functional organization.

Our aim is to provide insights into both the possibilities of the atlases, as well as to describe what more than a decade of developmental gene expression atlases can teach us about the requirements of the design of the 'ideal atlas'. This review shows that most ingredients needed to develop the ideal atlas are already applied to some extent in at least one of the discussed atlases.

The zebrafish pronephros is also associated with the corpuscles of Stannius (CS), endocrine glands that regulate calcium and phosphate homeostasis, but whose ontogeny from renal progenitors is largely mysterious. Initial patterning of zebrafish renal progenitors in the intermediate mesoderm (IM) involves the formation of rostral and caudal domains, the former being reliant on retinoic acid (RA) signaling, and the latter being repressed by elevated RA levels. Here, using expression profiling to gain new insights into nephrogenesis, we discovered that the gene single minded family bHLH transcription factor 1a (sim1a) is dynamically expressed in the renal progenitors-first marking the caudal domain, then becoming restricted to the proximal segments, and finally exhibiting specific CS expression. In loss of function studies, sim1a knockdown expanded the PCT and abrogated both the PST and CS populations. Conversely, overexpression of sim1a modestly expanded the PST and CS, while it reduced the PCT. These results show that sim1a activity is necessary and partially sufficient to induce PST and CS fates, and suggest that sim1a may inhibit PCT fate and/or negotiate the PCT/PST boundary. Interestingly, the sim1a expression domain in renal progenitors is responsive to altered levels of RA, suggesting that RA regulates sim1a, directly or indirectly, during nephrogenesis. sim1a deficient embryos treated with exogenous RA formed nephrons that were predominantly composed of PCT segments, but lacked the enlarged PST observed in RA treated wild-types, indicating that RA is not sufficient to rescue the PST in the absence of sim1a expression. Alternately, when sim1a knockdowns were exposed to the RA inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB), the CS was abrogated rather than expanded as seen in DEAB treated wild-types, revealing that CS formation in the absence of sim1a cannot be rescued by RA biosynthesis abrogation. Taken together, these data reveal previously unappreciated roles for sim1a in zebrafish pronephric proximal tubule and CS patterning, and are consistent with the model that sim1a acts downstream of RA to mitigate the formation of these lineages. These findings provide new insights into the genetic pathways that direct nephron development, and may have implications for understanding renal birth defects and kidney reprogramming.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Renal cystic diseases and congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract comprise a heterogeneous group of lesions whose pathogenesis has eluded physicians for centuries. Recent advances in molecular and genetic understanding of these diseases may provide the solution to this riddle.
OBJECTIVE: The formulation of an effective classification system for these disorders has been elusive but is needed to introduce order while providing a conceptual framework for diagnosis.
DATA SOURCES: This review discusses the evolution, beginning in the 19th century, of postulates regarding the pathogenesis of cystic and developmental renal diseases. Selected classification systems proffered during this period are discussed in pursuit of an ideal classification schema that would account for morphologic features and their clinical importance, with logical links to pathogenesis and treatment. Although this remains an elusive target, its general outline is becoming clearer. A classification approach favored by the author is presented, which incorporates many of the strengths contained in several previous classifications.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic-and molecular-based postulates regarding the pathogenesis of the renal cystic and developmental diseases have implicated mutated master genes and the modification of genes that are crucial in renal development and genes that are central to the sensory effects of the renal tubular primary cilium on cell physiology. These scientific advances provide pathogenetic links between morphologically and genetically distinct entities and certain cystic and neoplastic entities, associations that seemed implausible not long ago. These advances may eventually provide the basis for future classification systems while suggesting targets for therapeutic approaches in the prevention and treatment of these diseases.},

	abstract = {Genetic interactions regulating intermediate stages of tubulogenesis in the developing kidney have been difficult to define. A systems biology strategy using microarray was combined with in vitro/ex vivo and genetic approaches to identify pathways regulating specific stages of tubulogenesis. Analysis of the progression of the metanephric mesenchyme (MM) through four stages of tubule induction and differentiation (i.e., epithelialization, tubular organization and elongation and early differentiation) revealed signaling pathways potentially involved at each stage and suggested key roles for a number of signaling molecules. A screen of the signaling pathways on in vitro/ex vivo nephron formation implicated a unique regulatory role for protein kinase A (PKA), through PKA-2, in a specific post-epithelialization morphogenetic step (conversion of the renal vesicle to the S-shaped body). Microarray analysis not only confirmed this stage-specificity, but also highlighted the upregulation of Wnt genes. Addition of PKA agonists to LIF-induced nephrons (previously shown to be a Wnt/beta-catenin dependent pathway) disrupted normal tubulogenesis in a manner similar to PKA-agonist treated MM/spinal-cord assays, suggesting that PKA regulates a Wnt-dependent tubulogenesis step. PKA induction of canonical Wnt signaling during tubulogenesis was confirmed genetically using MM from Batgal-reporter mice. Addition of a Wnt synthesis inhibitor to activated PKA cultures rescued tubulogenesis. By re-analysis of existing microarray data from the FGF8, Lim1 and Wnt4 knockouts, which arrest in early tubulogenesis, a network of genes involving PKA, Wnt, Lhx1, FGF8, and hyaluronic acid signaling regulating the transition of nascent epithelial cells to tubular epithelium was derived, helping to reconcile in vivo and in vitro/ex vivo data.},

Renal vesicle, early proximal and distal tubule, loop of Henle, and renal corpuscle genes were expressed by mesonephric tubules. Vip, Slc6a20b, and Slc18a1 were male-specific.

	abstract = {PURPOSE
A recent genome-wide association study reported the novel finding that variants in diacylglycerol kinase kappa (DGKK) were associated with hypospadias. Our objectives were to determine whether this finding could be replicated in a more racially-ethnically diverse study population of California births and to provide a more comprehensive investigation of variants.

METHODS
We examined the association of 27 DGKK SNPs with hypospadias, relative to population-based non-malformed controls born in selected California counties from 1990-2003. Analyses included a maximum of 928 controls and 665 cases (91 mild, 336 moderate, 221 severe, 17 undetermined). Results for mild and moderate cases were similar so they were grouped together.

RESULTS
For mild and moderate cases, odds ratios (OR) for 15 of the 27 SNPs had p-values {\textless}0.05; two were {\textless}1, and the others ranged from 1.3 to 1.8. Among severe cases, ORs tended to be closer to one and none of the p-values were {\textless}0.05. Due to high LD across the SNPs, haplotype analyses were conducted, and two blocks were generated. These analyses identified a set of eight variants that was associated with a three- to four- fold increased risk, relative to the most common haplotype, regardless of severity of the phenotype (the OR was 4.1, p{\textless}10-4 for mild to moderate cases and 3.3, p=0.001 for severe cases).

CONCLUSIONS
This study confirms that DGKK variants are associated with hypospadias. Further studies are needed to enable a more thorough investigation of DGKK variability and to delineate the mechanism by which DGKK contributes to urethral development.},

Both this gene, and its mouse ortholog, Pkhd1, are primarily expressed in renal and biliary ductal structures. The mouse protein product, fibrocystin/polyductin complex (FPC), is a 445-kDa protein encoded by a 67-exon transcript that spans {\textgreater}500 kb of genomic DNA. In the current study, we observed multiple alternatively spliced Pkhd1 transcripts that varied in size and exon composition in embryonic mouse kidney, liver, and placenta samples, as well as among adult mouse pancreas, brain, heart, lung, testes, liver, and kidney. Using reverse transcription PCR and RNASeq, we identified 22 novel Pkhd1 kidney transcripts with unique exon junctions. Various mechanisms of alternative splicing were observed, including exon skipping, use of alternate acceptor/donor splice sites, and inclusion of novel exons. Bioinformatic analyses identified, and exon-trapping minigene experiments validated, consensus binding sites for serine/arginine-rich proteins that modulate alternative splicing. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we examined the functional importance of selected splice enhancers. In addition, we demonstrated that many of the novel transcripts were polysome bound, thus likely translated. Finally, we determined that the human PKHD1 R760H missense variant alters a splice enhancer motif that disrupts exon splicing in vitro and is predicted to truncate the protein. Taken together, these data provide evidence of the complex transcriptional regulation of Pkhd1/PKHD1 and identified motifs that regulate its splicing. Our studies indicate that Pkhd1/PKHD1 transcription is modulated, in part by intragenic factors, suggesting that aberrant PKHD1 splicing represents an unappreciated pathogenic mechanism in ARPKD. Key messages: Multiple mRNA transcripts are generated for Pkhd1 in renal tissues Pkhd1 transcription is modulated by standard splice elements and effectors Mutations in splice motifs may alter splicing to generate nonfunctional peptides.},

Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) identified seven individuals with overlapping deletions in the 2p15 region (66.0 kb-5.6 Mb). Six of these patients have GU defects, while the remaining patient has no GU defect. These deletions encompass the transcription factor OTX1. Subjects 2-7 had large de novo CNVs (2.39-6.31 Mb) and exhibited features similar to those associated with the 2p15p16.1 and 2p15p14 microdeletion syndromes, including developmental delay, short stature, and variable GU defects. Subject-1 with BEEC had the smallest deletion (66 kb), which deleted only one copy of OTX1. Otx1-null mice have seizures, prepubescent transient growth retardation and gonadal defects. Two subjects have short stature, two have seizures, and six have GU defects, mainly affecting the external genitalia. The presence of GU defects in six patients in our cohort and eight of thirteen patients reported with deletions within 2p14p16.1 (two with deletion of OTX1) suggest that genes in 2p15 are important for GU development. Genitalia defects in these patients could result from the effect of OTX1 on pituitary hormone secretion or on the regulation of SHH signaling, which is crucial for development of the bladder and genitalia.},

To demonstrate the potential of this resource to implicate developmentally critical features, we focused on gene expression patterns and pathways in the sexually indeterminate, androgen-independent GT. GT expression patterns reinforced the proposed similarities between development of GT, limb, and craniofacial prominences. Comparison of spatial expression patterns predicted a network of Wnt7a-associated GT-enriched epithelial genes, including Gjb2, Dsc3, Krt5, and Sostdc1. Known from other contexts, these genes are associated with normal epidermal differentiation, with disruptions in Dsc3 and Gjb2 showing palmo-plantar keratoderma in the limb.

Top compartment-specific genes implicated by the microarray data were validated using whole-mount in situ hybridization (ISH) over the entire LUT. To demonstrate the potential of this resource to implicate developmentally critical features, we focused on gene expression patterns and pathways in the sexually indeterminate, androgen-independent GT. GT expression patterns reinforced the proposed similarities between development of GT, limb, and craniofacial prominences. Comparison of spatial expression patterns predicted a network of Wnt7a-associated GT-enriched epithelial genes, including Gjb2, Dsc3, Krt5, and Sostdc1. Known from other contexts, these genes are associated with normal epidermal differentiation, with disruptions in Dsc3 and Gjb2 showing palmo-plantar keratoderma in the limb. We propose that this gene network contributes to normal foreskin, scrotum, and labial development. As several of these genes are known to be regulated by, or contain cis elements responsive to retinoic acid, estrogen, or androgen, this implicates this pathway in the later androgen-dependent development of the GT.},

	abstract = {Urothelial carcinoma (UC) causes substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying urothelial cancer development and tumor progression are still largely unknown. Using informatics analysis, we identified Sh3gl2 (endophilin A1) as a bladder urothelium-enriched transcript. The gene encoding Sh3gl2 is located on chromosome 9p, a region frequently altered in UC. Sh3gl2 is known to regulate endocytosis of receptor tyrosine kinases implicated in oncogenesis, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-Met. However, its role in UC pathogenesis is unknown. Informatics analysis of expression profiles as well as immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays revealed Sh3gl2 expression to be decreased in UC specimens compared to nontumor tissues. Loss of Sh3gl2 was associated with increasing tumor grade and with muscle invasion, which is a reliable predictor of metastatic disease and cancer-derived mortality. Sh3gl2 expression was undetectable in 19 of 20 human UC cell lines but preserved in the low-grade cell line RT4. Stable silencing of Sh3gl2 in RT4 cells by RNA interference 1) enhanced proliferation and colony formation in vitro, 2) inhibited EGF-induced EGFR internalization and increased EGFR activation, 3) stimulated phosphorylation of Src family kinases and STAT3, and 4) promoted growth of RT4 xenografts in subrenal capsule tissue recombination experiments. Conversely, forced re-expression of Sh3gl2 in T24 cells and silenced RT4 clones attenuated oncogenic behaviors, including growth and migration. Together, these findings identify loss of Sh3gl2 as a frequent event in UC development that promotes disease progression.},

	issn = {1932-6203},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0029372},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: During normal development in human and other placental mammals, the embryonic cloacal cavity separates along the axial longitudinal plane to give rise to the urethral system, ventrally, and the rectum, dorsally. Defects in cloacal development are very common and present clinically as a rectourethral fistula in about 1 in 5,000 live human births. Yet, the cellular mechanisms of cloacal septation remain poorly understood.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We previously detected Bone morphogenetic protein 7 (Bmp7) expression in the urorectal mesenchyme (URM), and have shown that loss of Bmp7 function results in the arrest of cloacal septation. Here, we present evidence that cloacal partitioning is driven by Bmp7 signaling in the cloacal endoderm. We performed TUNEL and immunofluorescent analysis on cloacal sections from Bmp7 null and control littermate embryos. We found that loss of Bmp7 results in a dramatic decrease in the endoderm survival and a delay in differentiation. We used immunological methods to show that Bmp7 functions by activating the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. We carried out confocal and 3D imaging analysis of mitotic chromosome bundles to show that during normal septation cells in the cloacal endoderm divide predominantly in the apical-basal direction. Loss of Bmp7/JNK signaling results in randomization of mitotic angles in the cloacal endoderm. We also conducted immunohistochemical analysis of human fetal sections to show that BMP/phospho-SMAD and JNK pathways function in the human cloacal region similar as in the mouse.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results strongly indicate that Bmp7/JNK signaling regulates remodeling of the cloacal endoderm resulting in a topological separation of the urinary and digestive systems. Our study points to the importance of Bmp and JNK signaling in cloacal development and rectourethral malformations.},

While regulators of certain aspects of steroidogenesis are known, the initial driver of steroidogenesis in the human and rodent fetal testis is unclear. Through comparative analysis of rodent fetal testis microarray datasets, 54 candidate fetal Leydig cell-specific genes were identified. Fetal mouse testis interstitial expression of a subset of these genes with unknown expression (Crhr1, Gramd1b, Itih5, Vgll3, and Vsnl1) was verified by whole-mount in situ hybridization. Among the candidate fetal Leydig cell-specific factors, three receptors (CRHR1, PRLR, and PROKR2) were tested for a steroidogenic function using ex vivo fetal testes treated with receptor agonists (CRH, PRL, and PROK2). While PRL and PROK2 had no effect, CRH, at low (approximately 1 to 10) nM concentration, increased expression of the steroidogenic genes Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, Scarb1, and Star in GD15 mouse and GD17 rat testes, and in conjunction, testosterone production was increased. Exposure of GD15 fetal mouse testis to a specific CRHR1 antagonist blunted the CRH-induced steroidogenic gene expression and testosterone responses. Similar to ex vivo rodent fetal testes, ≥ 10 nM CRH exposure of MA-10 Leydig cells increased steroidogenic pathway mRNA and progesterone levels, showing CRH can enhance steroidogenesis by directly targeting Leydig cells. Crh mRNA expression was observed in rodent fetal hypothalamus, and CRH peptide was detected in rodent amniotic fluid. Together, these data provide a resource for discovering factors controlling fetal Leydig cell biology and suggest that CRHR1 activation by CRH stimulates rat and mouse fetal Leydig cell steroidogenesis in vivo.},

To identify novel modulators of lymphangiogenesis, we used a mouse model of HLT (Ragged Opossum) and performed gene expression profiling of aberrant dermal lymphatic vessels. Expression studies and functional analysis in zebrafish and mice revealed one candidate, ArfGAP with RhoGAP domain, Ankyrin repeat and PH domain 3 (ARAP3), which is down-regulated in HLT mouse lymphatic vessels and necessary for lymphatic vascular development in mice and zebrafish. We position this known regulator of cell behaviour during migration as a mediator of the cellular response to Vegfc signalling in lymphatic endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo.

We expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged to ribosomal protein L10a in podocytes under the control of the collagen-1α1 promoter, enabling one-step podocyte-specific mRNA isolation over the course of disease. This TRAP protocol robustly enriched known podocyte-specific mRNAs. We crossed Col1α1-eGFP-L10a mice with the Actn4(-/-) and Actn4(+/K256E) models of FSGS and analyzed podocyte transcriptional profiles at 2, 6, and 44 weeks of age. Two upregulated podocyte genes in murine FSGS (CXCL1 and DMPK) were found to be upregulated at the protein level in biopsies from patients with FSGS, validating this approach. There was no dilution of podocyte-specific transcripts during disease. These are the first podocyte-specific RNA expression data sets during aging and in two models of FSGS.

Nascent nephrons subsequently undergo elongation, segmentation, and differentiation into a mature renal epithelium with diverse functions. Epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in impacting cell fate decisions during nephrogenesis; however, the chromatin landscape of nephron progenitors and daughter differentiating cells are largely unknown. Here, we examined the spatiotemporal expression patterns of histone H3 methylation and histone methyltransferases in E15.5 mouse kidneys. Kidney sections were probed with antibodies against histone modifications, enzymes, and markers of progenitors and differentiation. The results revealed that: (1) nephron progenitor cells exhibit a broad histone methylation signature that comprises both "active" and "repressive" marks (H3K4me3/K9me3/K27me3/R2me2/R17me2); (2) nascent nephrons retain high H3K4me3 but show downregulation of H3K9/K27me3 and; (3) maturing epithelial tubules acquire high levels of H3K79me2/3. Consistent with respective histone marks, the H3K4 methyltransferase, Ash2l, is expressed in progenitors and nascent nephrons, whereas the H3K9/K27 methyltransferases, G9a/Ezh2, are more enriched in progenitors than nascent nephrons. We conclude that combinatorial histone signatures correlate with cell fate decisions during nephrogenesis.},

However, the spatiotemporal expression patterns of the AQP gene family during tubular maturation and the potential influence of genetic variation on these patterns and on water handling remain unknown. We investigated the expression patterns of all AQP isoforms in fetal (E13.5 to E18.5), postnatal (P1 to P28), and adult (9 weeks) kidneys of inbred (C57BL/6J) and outbred (CD-1) mice. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we evidenced two mRNA patterns during tubular maturation in C57 mice. The AQPs 1-7-11 showed an early (from E14.5) and progressive increase to adult levels, similar to the mRNA pattern observed for proximal tubule markers (Megalin, NaPi-IIa, OAT1) and reflecting the continuous increase in renal cortical structures during development. By contrast, AQPs 2-3-4 showed a later (E15.5) and more abrupt increase, with transient postnatal overexpression. Most AQP genes were expressed earlier and/or stronger in maturing CD-1 kidneys. Furthermore, adult CD-1 kidneys expressed more AQP2 in the collecting ducts, which was reflected by a significant delay in excreting a water load. The expression patterns of proximal vs. distal AQPs and the earlier expression in the CD-1 strain were confirmed by immunoblotting and immunostaining. These data (1) substantiate the clustering of important genes during tubular maturation and (2) demonstrate that genetic variability influences the regulation of the AQP gene family during tubular maturation and water handling by the mature kidney.},

	abstract = {Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are the leading cause of childhood chronic kidney disease (CKD). While mutations in several renal development genes have been identified as causes for CAKUT, most cases have not yet been linked to known mutations. Furthermore, the genotype-phenotype correlation is variable, suggesting that there might be additional factors that have an impact on the severity of CAKUT. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, and are involved in many developmental processes. Although little is known about the function of specific miRNAs in kidney development, several have recently been shown to regulate the expression of, and/or are regulated by, crucial renal development genes present in other organ systems. In this review, we discuss how miRNA regulation of common developmental signaling pathways may be applicable to renal development. We focus on genes that are known to contribute to CAKUT in humans, for which miRNA interactions in other contexts have been identified, with miRNAs that are present in the kidney. We hypothesize that miRNA-mediated processes might play a role in kidney development through similar mechanisms, and speculate that genotypic variations in these small RNAs or their targets could be associated with CAKUT.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the field of mouse genetics the advent of technologies like microarray based expression profiling dramatically increased data availability and sensitivity, yet these advanced methods are often vulnerable to the unavoidable heterogeneity of in vivo material and might therefore reflect differentially expressed genes between mouse strains of no relevance to a targeted experiment. The aim of this study was not to elaborate on the usefulness of microarray analysis in general, but to expand our knowledge regarding this potential "background noise" for the widely used Illumina microarray platform surpassing existing data which focused primarily on the adult sensory and nervous system, by analyzing patterns of gene expression at different embryonic stages using wild type strains and modern transgenic models of often non-isogenic backgrounds.
RESULTS: Wild type embryos of 11 mouse strains commonly used in transgenic and molecular genetic studies at three developmental time points were subjected to Illumina microarray expression profiling in a strain-by-strain comparison. Our data robustly reflects known gene expression patterns during mid-gestation development. Decreasing diversity of the input tissue and/or increasing strain diversity raised the sensitivity of the array towards the genetic background. Consistent strain sensitivity of some probes was attributed to genetic polymorphisms or probe design related artifacts.
CONCLUSION: Our study provides an extensive reference list of gene expression profiling background noise of value to anyone in the field of developmental biology and transgenic research performing microarray expression profiling with the widely used Illumina microarray platform. Probes identified as strain specific background noise further allow for microarray expression profiling on its own to be a valuable tool for establishing genealogies of mouse inbred strains.},

However, the role of CD151 in podocytes has not been investigated so far. In the present study, we utilized a conditionally immortalized mouse podocyte cell line to characterize CD151 in podocytes and to examine the consequences of manipulating CD151 expression levels. Mouse podocytes endogenously express CD151 as determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting. GFP-CD151 fusion protein localized to the cell membrane, to cell protrusions and cell-cell contacts, colocalizing with actin, β(1)-integrin, zonula occludens-1, and CD9. The expression of GFP-CD151 in cultured podocytes resulted in a marked increase in the presence of thin arborized protrusions (TAPs). TAPs are distinct from filopodia by increased length, protein composition, branched morphology, and slower dynamics. Furthermore, the migration rate of pEGFP-CD151-transfected podocytes was reduced in a wound assay. Fluorescence recovery after photo bleaching measurements revealed a half-time of 3 s for GFP-CD151 consistent with a high mobility of CD151 in the membrane and cytosol. CD151 knockdown in podocytes reduced β(1)-integrin expression and podocyte cell area, indicating diminished adherence and/or spreading. Our results indicate that CD151 importantly modulates podocyte function.},

One of the advantages of the mouse kidney as an experimental system is that it can develop in culture, from the stage of initial branching of the UB (E11.5) for up to a week (although it achieves the size and degree of development of only an E13.5-E14.5 kidney in vivo). The availability of fluorescent proteins (FPs) has provided powerful tools for visualizing the morphogenesis of specific renal structures in organ cultures. Two categories of genetically modified mice that express FPs are useful for visualizing different cell lineages and developmental processes in these organ cultures: (1) transgenic mice that express a fluorescent reporter in the pattern of a specific gene; and (2) Cre reporter mice, which turn on an FP in cells with Cre recombinase activity (and their daughter cells), used in conjunction with cell type-specific Cre transgenic mice. Here, we describe some of the currently available Cre and FP transgenic lines that are useful for the study of kidney development.},

In order to shed light on human kidney development, we have used single-cell transcriptomics to characterize gene expression in different cell populations, and to study individual cell dynamics and lineage trajectories during development. Single-cell transcriptome analyses of 6414 cells from five individual specimens identified 11 initial clusters of specific renal cell types as defined by their gene expression profile. Further subclustering identifies progenitors, and mature and intermediate stages of differentiation for several renal lineages. Other lineages identified include mesangium, stroma, endothelial and immune cells. Novel markers for these cell types were revealed in the analysis, as were components of key signaling pathways driving renal development in animal models. Altogether, we provide a comprehensive and dynamic gene expression profile of the developing human kidney at the single-cell level.},

Ureteric bud (UB) emergence from the Wolffian duct (WD), the initiating step in metanephric kidney morphogenesis, is dependent on GDNF; however, GDNF by itself is generally insufficient to induce robust budding of the isolated WD in culture. Thus, additional factors, presumably peptides or polypeptide growth factors, might be involved. Microarray data from in vivo budding and non-budding conditions were analyzed using non-negative matrix factorization followed by gene ontology filtering and network analysis to identify sets of genes that are highly regulated during budding. These included the GDNF co-receptors GFRα1 and RET, as well as neuropeptide Y (NPY). By using ANOVA with pattern matching, NPY was also found to correlate most significantly to the budded condition with a high degree of connectedness to genes with developmental roles. Exogenous NPY [as well as its homolog, peptide YY (PYY)] augmented GDNF-dependent budding in the isolated WD culture; conversely, inhibition of NPY signaling or perturbation of NPY expression inhibited budding, confirming that NPY facilitates this process. NPY was also found to reverse the decreased budding, the downregulation of RET expression, the mislocalization of GFRα1, and the inhibition of AKT phosphorylation that resulted from the addition of BMP4 to the isolated WD cultures, suggesting that NPY acts through the budding pathway and is reciprocally regulated by GDNF and BMP4. Thus, the outgrowth of the UB from the WD might result from a combination of the upregulation of the GDNF receptors together with genes that support GDNF signaling in a feed-forward loop and/or counteraction of the inhibitory pathway regulated by BMP4.},

Developmental anatomic and functional maturation time points are important to consider between juveniles and adults when regarding different organ toxicities in response to drug administration. The kidney is an example of a major organ that has differences in these time points in comparing juveniles to adults and in contrasting humans to laboratory animal species. Toxicologic pathologists, involved in juvenile studies, need to be aware of these time points which are age-related exposure periods of sensitivity to drug toxicity. Age-related developmental anatomic and functional maturation are factors which can affect the way that a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted (ADME). Changes to any component of ADME may alter drug toxicity resulting in kidney abnormalities, nephrotoxicity, or maturational disorders. Juvenile animal kidneys may either be less resistant or more resistant to known adult nephrotoxic drug effects. Furthermore, drug toxicity observed in juvenile animal kidneys may not always correspond to similar toxicities in humans. Juvenile animal nonclinical toxicology studies targeting the kidneys have to be carefully planned to attain the maximum knowledge from each study.},

Subsequent analyses in mice revealed expression for both genes in the genital region during stages relevant to the development of CBE in humans. Unfortunately, we were not able to replicate the suggestive signal for WNT3 and WNT9B in a sample that was enriched for non-CBE BEEC cases (P = 0.51).

During embryogenesis, progenitor cells expressing the Wilms tumor suppressor gene, WT1, are induced to differentiate in response to WNT signals from the ureteric bud. In hereditary Wilms tumors, clonal loss of WT1 precludes the β-catenin pathway response and leads to precancerous nephrogenic rests. We hypothesized that WT1 normally primes progenitor cells for differentiation by suppressing the enhancer of zeste2 gene (EZH2), involved in epigenetic silencing of differentiation genes. In human amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells, we show that exogenous WT1B represses EZH2 transcription. This leads to a dramatic decrease in the repressive lysine 27 trimethylation mark on histone H3 that silences β-catenin gene expression. As a result, amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells acquire responsiveness to WNT9b and increase expression of genes that mark the onset of nephron differentiation. Our observations suggest that biallelic loss of WT1 sustains the inhibitory histone methylation state that characterizes Wilms tumors.},

METHODS: Here, we investigated whether this chromosomal aberration was commonly associated with CBE/bladder exstrophy and epispadias complex in an extended case-control sample. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and microarray-based analysis were used to identify 22q11.21 duplications in 244 unrelated bladder exstrophy and epispadias complex patients (including 217 CBE patients) and 665 healthy controls.
RESULTS: New duplications of variable size were identified in four CBE patients and one control. Pooling of our previous and present data (eight duplications in 313 CBE patients) yielded a combined odds ratio of 31.86 (95\% confidence interval, 4.24-1407.97). Array-based sequence capture and high-throughput targeted re-sequencing established that all breakpoints resided within the low-copy repeats 22A to 22D. Comparison of the eight duplications revealed a 414 kb phenocritical region harboring 12 validated RefSeq genes. Characterization of these 12 candidate genes through whole-mount in situ hybridization of mouse embryos at embryonic day 9.5 suggested that CRKL, THAP7, and LZTR1 are CBE candidate genes.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that duplication of 22q11.21 increases CBE risk and implicate a phenocritical region in disease formation.},

	abstract = {Despite mounting evidence that p53 senses and responds to physiological cues in vivo, existing knowledge regarding p53 function and target genes is largely derived from studies in cancer or stressed cells. Herein we utilize p53 transcriptome and ChIP-Seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation-high throughput sequencing) analyses to identify p53 regulated pathways in the embryonic kidney, an organ that develops via mesenchymal-epithelial interactions. This integrated approach allowed identification of novel genes that are possible direct p53 targets during kidney development. We find the p53-regulated transcriptome in the embryonic kidney is largely composed of genes regulating developmental, morphogenesis, and metabolic pathways. Surprisingly, genes in cell cycle and apoptosis pathways account for {\textless}5\% of differentially expressed transcripts. Of 7,893 p53-occupied genomic regions (peaks), the vast majority contain consensus p53 binding sites. Interestingly, 78\% of p53 peaks in the developing kidney lie within proximal promoters of annotated genes compared with 7\% in a representative cancer cell line; 25\% of the differentially expressed p53-bound genes are present in nephron progenitors and nascent nephrons, including key transcriptional regulators, components of Fgf, Wnt, Bmp, and Notch pathways, and ciliogenesis genes. The results indicate widespread p53 binding to the genome in vivo and context-dependent differences in the p53 regulon between cancer, stress, and development. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of the p53 transcriptome and cistrome in a developing mammalian organ, substantiating the role of p53 as a bona fide developmental regulator. We conclude p53 targets transcriptional networks regulating nephrogenesis and cellular metabolism during kidney development.},

Urinary biomarkers may be potential indicators of renal reserve, but little is known about the influence of gestational and postnatal age on the expression of urinary proteins. The aims of this study were to determine the relationships between selected urinary proteins and renal maturation. We hypothesized that urinary protein patterns would change over time during late nephrogenesis and renal maturation.
METHODS: Urine samples were collected at birth and over 12 mo from preterm (33-35 wk) and term (38-40 wk) infants. Candidate urinary proteins were identified by antibody array and quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Preterm infants at birth were found to have relatively elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1, -2, and -6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, CD14, and sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 5. These markers gradually decline to levels similar to those of full-term infants by 2-6 mo of life. In contrast, many urinary markers in healthy full-term infants remain stable over the first year of life.
CONCLUSION: Gestational and postnatal age must be considered when evaluating the utility of urinary biomarkers.},

Today, biopsy specimens are read using a combination of light microscopy, electron microscopy, and indirect immunofluorescence, with a limited number of antibodies. These techniques all were perfected decades ago with only incremental changes since then. By contrast, recent advances in single-cell genomics are transforming scientists' ability to characterize cells. Rather than measure the expression of several genes at a time by immunofluorescence, it now is possible to measure the expression of thousands of genes in thousands of single cells simultaneously. Here, we argue that the development of single-cell RNA sequencing offers an opportunity to describe human kidney disease comprehensively at a cellular level. It is particularly well suited for the analysis of immune cells, which are characterized by multiple subtypes and changing functions depending on their environment. In this review, we summarize the development of single-cell RNA sequencing methodologies. We discuss how these approaches are being applied in other organs, and the potential for this powerful technology to transform our understanding of kidney disease once applied to the renal biopsy.},

It is the most common urological problem in children, with an estimated prevalence of 1-2\%, and is a major cause of hypertension in childhood and of renal failure in childhood or adult life. We present the results of a genetic linkage and association scan using 900,000 markers. Our linkage results show a large number of suggestive linkage peaks, with different results in two groups of families, suggesting that VUR is even more genetically heterogeneous than previously imagined. The only marker achieving P {\textless} 0.02 for linkage in both groups of families is 270 kb from EMX2. In three sibships, we found recessive linkage to KHDRBS3, previously reported in a Somali family. In another family we discovered sex-reversal associated with VUR, implicating PRKX, for which there was weak support for dominant linkage in the overall data set. Several other candidate genes are suggested by our linkage or association results, and four of our linkage peaks are within copy-number variants recently found to be associated with renal hypodysplasia. Undoubtedly there are many genes related to VUR. Our study gives support to some loci suggested by earlier studies as well as suggesting new ones, and provides numerous indications for further investigations.},

However the spatial organization of developing innervation in the murine urogenital tract (UGT) and the gene networks that regulate specification and maturation of neurons within the pelvic ganglia of the lower urinary tract (LUT) are unknown. We used whole-mount immunohistochemistry and histochemical stains to localize neural elements in 15.5 days post coitus (dpc) fetal mice. To identify potential regulatory factors expressed in pelvic ganglia, we surveyed expression patterns for known or probable transcription factors (TF) annotated in the mouse genome by screening a whole-mount in situ hybridization library of fetal UGTs. Of the 155 genes detected in pelvic ganglia, 88 encode TFs based on the presence of predicted DNA-binding domains. Neural crest (NC)-derived progenitors within the LUT were labeled by Sox10, a well-known regulator of NC development. Genes identified were categorized based on patterns of restricted expression in pelvic ganglia, pelvic ganglia and urethral epithelium, or pelvic ganglia and urethral mesenchyme. Gene expression patterns and the distribution of Sox10+, Phox2b+, Hu+, and PGP9.5+ cells within developing ganglia suggest previously unrecognized regional segregation of Sox10+ progenitors and differentiating neurons in early development of pelvic ganglia. Reverse transcription-PCR of pelvic ganglia RNA from fetal and post-natal stages demonstrated that multiple TFs maintain post-natal expression, although Pax3 is extinguished before weaning. Our analysis identifies multiple potential regulatory genes including TFs that may participate in segregation of discrete lineages within pelvic ganglia. The genes identified here are attractive candidate disease genes that may now be further investigated for their roles in malformation syndromes or in LUT dysfunction.},

Bioinformatics analysis suggests developmental stage-specific pathway activation and highlighted heterochromatin protein 1 (Cbx1, Cbx3, Cbx5) and Trim28 as potential key players in nephrogenesis. These are involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene silencing and were down-regulated in the course of kidney development. Trim28 is a potential epigenetic regulator of the branching inhibitor Bmp4. Silencing of Trim28 in cultured kidneys resulted in branching arrest. In contrast knockdown of Cbx5 was associated with abnormal ureteric bud growth and slight impairment of branching. ChIP analysis showed that the H3K9me3 distribution on Bmp4 promoters at E14 and E19 inversely correlate with mRNA expression levels. The concentrated expression-pattern of heterochromatin proteins and the negative impact of their silencing on kidney development, suggest an important role in reciprocal and inductive signaling between the ureteric bud and the metanephric mesenchyme.},

STAT5 activation in the DP began in late catagen, reaching a peak in early anagen before disappearing for the rest of the cycle. This was confirmed by the expression profile of suppressor of cytokine signaling 2, a STAT5 target in the DP. This pattern of expression starts after the first postnatal hair cycle. Quantification of hair cycling using the Flash canonical Wnt signaling in vivo bioluminescence reporter found that conditional knockout of STAT5A/B in the DP targeted through Cre-recombinase under the control of the Sox18 promoter resulted in delayed anagen entry compared with control. Microarray analysis of STAT5 deletion versus control revealed key changes in tumor necrosis factor-α, Wnt, and fibroblast growth factor ligands, known for their role in inducing anagen entry.

	abstract = {Epigenetic modulation of podocyte injury plays a pivotal role in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Wilm's tumor 1 (WT1) has been found to have opposing roles with β-catenin in podocyte biology. Herein, we asked whether the histone methyltransferase enzyme enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) promotes WT1-induced podocyte injury via β-catenin activation and the underlying mechanisms. We found that WT1 antagonized EZH2 and ameliorated β-catenin-mediated podocyte injury as demonstrated by attenuated podocyte mesenchymal transition, maintenance of podocyte architectural integrity, decreased podocyte apoptosis and oxidative stress. Further, we provided mechanistical evidence that EZH2 was required in WT1-mediated β-catenin inactivation via repression of secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP-1), a Wnt antagonist. Moreover, EZH2-mediated silencing of SFRP-1 was due to increased histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) on its promoter region. WT1 favored renal function and decreased podocyte injury in diabetic rats and DN patients. Notably, WT1 exhibited clinical and biological relevance as it was linked to dropped serum creatinine, decreased proteinuria and elevated estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). We propose an epigenetic process via the WT1/EZH2/β-catenin axis in attenuating podocyte injury in DN. Targeting WT1 and EZH2 could be potential therapeutic approaches for DN.},

The web-based interface of RGED allows users to query the gene expression profiles in various kidney-related samples, including renal cell lines, human kidney tissues and murine model kidneys. Researchers can explore certain gene profiles, the relationships between genes of interests and identify biomarkers or even drug targets in kidney diseases. The aim of this work is to provide a user-friendly utility for the renal disease research community to query expression profiles of genes of their own interest without the requirement of advanced computational skills.

Detailed in situ hybridization studies of tip-enriched predictions identified UBT-enriched gene sets conserved between the mouse and human kidney. Comparative spatial analysis of their UBT niche expression highlighted distinct patterns of gene expression revealing novel molecular heterogeneity within the UBT progenitor population. To identify kidney-specific and shared programs of branching morphogenesis, comparative expression studies on the developing mouse lung were combined with in silico analysis of the developing mouse salivary gland. These studies highlight a shared gene set with multi-organ tip enrichment and a gene set specific to UBTs.

In adult kidneys, expression of Foxc1/2 is confined to the glomerular epithelial cells, i.e., podocytes. To bypass embryonic lethality of Foxc1/2 null mice, mice ubiquitously expressing inducible-Cre (ROSA26-CreERT2) or mice expressing Cre in podocytes (Nephrin-Cre) were mated with floxed-Foxc1 and floxed-Foxc2 mice. The CreERT2 was activated in adult mice by administrations of tamoxifen. Eight weeks after tamoxifen treatment, ROSA26-CreERT2; Foxc1+/flox; Foxc2flox/flox mice developed microalbuminuria, while ROSA26-Cre ERT2; Foxc1flox/flox; Foxc2+/flox mice had no microalbuminuria. The kidneys of conditional-Foxc1/2 null mice showed proteinaceous casts, protein reabsorption droplets in tubules and huge vacuoles in podocytes, indicating severe podocyte injury and massive proteinuria. Comparison of gene expression profiles revealed that Foxc1/2 maintain expression of genes necessary for podocyte function such as podocin and Cxcl12. In addition, mice with an innate podocyte-specific deletion of Foxc1/2 by Nephrin-Cre develop similar podocyte injury. These results demonstrate dose-dependence of Foxc1/2 gene in maintaining the podocyte with a more critical role for Foxc2 than Foxc1 and a critical role of Foxc1/2 in regulating expression of genes that maintain podocyte integrity.},

Technology advances, and the resulting multitude of imaging modalities, have led to a sharp rise in the quantity and quality of such images. In addition, computational models are increasingly used to study biological processes involving spatio-temporal changes from the cell to the organism level, e.g., the development of an embryo or the growth of a tumour, and models and images are extensively described in natural language, for example, in research publications and patient records. Together this leads to a major spatio-temporal data and model integration challenge. Biomedical atlases have emerged as a key technology in solving this integration problem. Such atlases typically include an image-based (2D and/or 3D) component as well as a conceptual representation (ontologies) of the organisms involved. In this chapter, we review the notion of atlases in the biomedical domain, how they can be created, how they provide an index to spatio-temporal experimental data, issues of atlas data integration and their use for the analysis of large volumes of biomedical data.},

	abstract = {Changing gene expression patterns is the essential driver of developmental processes. Growth factors, micro-RNAs, long intergenic noncoding RNAs, and epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, all work by impacting gene expression. The key features of developing cells, including their ability to communicate with others, are defined primarily by their gene-expression profiles. It is therefore clear that a gene-expression atlas of the developing kidney can provide a useful tool for the developmental nephrology research community. Toward this end, the GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy Project (GUDMAP) consortium has worked to create an atlas of the changing gene-expression patterns that drive kidney development. In this article, the global gene-expression profiling strategies of GUDMAP are reviewed. The initial work used laser-capture microdissection to purify multiple compartments of the developing kidney, including cap mesenchyme, renal vesicle, S-shaped bodies, proximal tubules, and more, which were then gene-expression profiled using microarrays. Resolution of the atlas was then improved by using transgenic mice with specific cell types labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP), allowing their purification and profiling. In addition, RNA-Seq replaced microarrays. Currently, the atlas is being pushed to the single-cell resolution using microfluidic approaches that allow high-throughput RNA-Seq analysis of hundreds of individual cells. Results can identify novel types of cells and define interesting heterogeneities present within cell populations.},

Uroplakins are expressed in developing and mature urothelium where they establish plaques associated with the permeability barrier. Their precise functional role in development and disease is unknown. Here, we disrupted Upk1b in vivo where its loss resulted in urothelial plaque disruption in the bladder and kidney. Upk1b(RFP/RFP) bladder urothelium appeared dysplastic with expansion of the progenitor cell markers, Krt14 and Krt5, increased Shh expression, and loss of terminal differentiation markers Krt20 and uroplakins. Upk1b(RFP/RFP) renal urothelium became stratified with altered cellular composition. Upk1b(RFP/RFP) mice developed age-dependent progressive hydronephrosis. Interestingly, 16\% of Upk1b(RFP/RFP) mice possessed unilateral duplex kidneys. Our study expands the role of uroplakins, mechanistically links plaque formation to urinary tract development and function, and provides a tantalizing connection between congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract along with functional deficits observed in a variety of urinary tract diseases. Thus, kidney and bladder urothelium are regionally distinct and remain highly plastic, capable of expansion through tissue-specific progenitor populations. Furthermore, Upk1b plays a previously unknown role in early kidney development representing a novel genetic target for congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract.},

Although nephrogenesis ends in the perinatal period, acute kidney injury (AKI) elicits repopulation of damaged nephrons. Interestingly, embryonic NPC infused into adult mice with AKI are incorporated into regenerating tubules. Since WNT/β-catenin signaling is crucial for primary nephrogenesis, we reasoned that it might also be needed for the endogenous repair mechanism and for integration of exogenous NPC. When we examined glycerol-induced AKI in adult mice bearing a β-catenin/TCF reporter transgene, endogenous tubular cells reexpressed the NPC marker, CD24, and showed widespread β-catenin/TCF signaling. We isolated CD24+ cells from E15 kidneys of mice with the canonical WNT signaling reporter. 40\% of cells responded to WNT3a in vitro and when infused into glycerol-injured adult, the cells exhibited β-catenin/TCF reporter activity when integrated into damaged tubules. When embryonic CD24+ cells were treated with a β-catenin/TCF pathway inhibitor (IWR-1) prior to infusion into glycerol-injured mice, tubular integration of cells was sharply reduced. Thus, the endogenous canonical β-catenin/TCF pathway is reactivated during recovery from AKI and is required for integration of exogenous embryonic renal progenitor cells into damaged tubules. These events appear to recapitulate the WNT-dependent inductive process which drives primary nephrogenesis.},

	abstract = {Nephron progenitor number determines nephron endowment; a reduced nephron count is linked to the onset of kidney disease. Several transcriptional regulators including Six2, Wt1, Osr1, Sall1, Eya1, Pax2, and Hox11 paralogues are required for specification and/or maintenance of nephron progenitors. However, little is known about the regulatory intersection of these players. Here, we have mapped nephron progenitor-specific transcriptional networks of Six2, Hoxd11, Osr1, and Wt1. We identified 373 multi-factor associated 'regulatory hotspots' around genes closely associated with progenitor programs. To examine their functional significance, we deleted 'hotspot' enhancer elements for Six2 and Wnt4. Removal of the distal enhancer for Six2 leads to a {\textasciitilde}40\% reduction in Six2 expression. When combined with a Six2 null allele, progeny display a premature depletion of nephron progenitors. Loss of the Wnt4 enhancer led to a significant reduction of Wnt4 expression in renal vesicles and a mildly hypoplastic kidney, a phenotype also enhanced in combination with a Wnt4 null mutation. To explore the regulatory landscape that supports proper target gene expression, we performed CTCF ChIP-seq to identify insulator-boundary regions. One such putative boundary lies between the Six2 and Six3 loci. Evidence for the functional significance of this boundary was obtained by deep sequencing of the radiation-induced Brachyrrhine (Br) mutant allele. We identified an inversion of the Six2/Six3 locus around the CTCF-bound boundary, removing Six2 from its distal enhancer regulation, but placed next to Six3 enhancer elements which support ectopic Six2 expression in the lens where Six3 is normally expressed. Six3 is now predicted to fall under control of the Six2 distal enhancer. Consistent with this view, we observed ectopic Six3 in nephron progenitors. 4C-seq supports the model for Six2 distal enhancer interactions in wild-type and Br/+ mouse kidneys. Together, these data expand our view of the regulatory genome and regulatory landscape underpinning mammalian nephrogenesis.},

We investigated the expression pattern of Dgkk during development of mouse external genitalia to better understand its function and mechanism in the etiology of hypospadias.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed Dgkk expression analysis via indirect immunofluorescence in histological sections of CD-1 mouse embryonic and postnatal male, female and diethylsilbestrol treated external genitalia. Histological findings were supplemented with DGKK expression analysis using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays.
RESULTS: In mouse external genitalia Dgkk was expressed in the membrane and cytoplasm of differentiating squamous epithelial cells of urethral plate/groove and epidermis but not in the undifferentiated epithelial cells of preputial lamina or basal layer of urethral groove epithelium. CD-1 gestation day 18 male mouse genital tubercle treated with oil or diethylstilbestrol showed similar patterns of Dgkk expression despite many morphological differences, including formation of preputial cleft observed in diethylsilbestrol treated mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Dgkk appears to be a marker or mediator of squamous cell differentiation during development of mouse external genitalia. However, no association exists between Dgkk expression and formation of preputial cleft in the genital tubercle of diethylsilbestrol treated mice, suggesting that these 2 events may follow independent pathways in mice. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of DGKK in hypospadias.},

Non-synonymous variants in ROBO2 have been found in a small proportion of patients with primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in various countries. Here we sequenced 1 kb of promoter and all exons of ROBO2b with intronic margins in 227 index cases with primary VUR in an Irish population and found 55 variants, of which 20 were novel. We assessed the variants for evolutionary conservation and investigated novel and uncommon known conserved variants in 23 further index cases and family members of all index cases (to check for segregation with VUR), and then in healthy controls if we found segregation of the variants with VUR. Apart from one non-synonymous variant that was previously found in controls, we did not find any of the six other previously reported non-synonymous variants, but found four new non-synonymous variants. Of those, only two segregated with the disorder (p.Pro522Thr and p.Val799Ile). The former was not present in any of 592 healthy controls; the latter was present in one control. There are now 35 reported non-synonymous coding variants of ROBO2b. The predicted pathogenicity of those that have so far been found exclusively in VUR patients does not differ from that predicted for those variants also found in controls. Thus, our finding does not completely rule out that some variants may be the sole cause of VUR, but it is clear from the overall frequency that most of them cannot be. However, it is possible that some of these variants may cause VUR in combination with a mutation in another gene.},

Using this model, both albumin uptake and glucose reabsorption are quantified as a function of time.

We performed unbiased single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) on cryopreserved human diabetic kidney samples to generate 23,980 single nucleus transcriptomes from three control and three early diabetic nephropathy samples. All major cell types of the kidney were represented in the final dataset. Side by side comparison demonstrated cell-type-specific changes in gene expression that are important for ion transport, angiogenesis, and immune cell activation. In particular, we show that the diabetic loop of Henle, late distal convoluted tubule, and principal cells all adopt a gene expression signature consistent with increased potassium secretion, including alterations in Na-K+-ATPase, WNK1, mineralocorticoid receptor and NEDD4L expression, as well as decreased paracellular calcium and magnesium reabsorption. We also identify strong angiogenic signatures in glomerular cell types, proximal convoluted tubule, distal convoluted tubule and principal cells. Taken together, these results suggest that increased potassium secretion and angiogenic signaling represent early kidney responses in human diabetic nephropathy.Significance Statement Single nucleus RNA sequencing revealed gene expression changes in early diabetic nephropathy that promote urinary potassium secretion and decreased calcium and magnesium reabsorption. Multiple cell types exhibited angiogenic signatures, which may represent early signs of aberrant angiogenesis. These alterations may help to identify biomarkers for disease progression or signaling pathways amenable to early intervention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A challenge for single-cell genomic studies in kidney and other solid tissues is generating a high-quality single-cell suspension that contains rare or difficult-to-dissociate cell types and is free of both RNA degradation and artifactual transcriptional stress responses. METHODS: We compared single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using the DropSeq platform with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) using sNuc-DropSeq, DroNc-seq, and 10X Chromium platforms  on adult mouse kidney. We validated snRNA-seq on fibrotic kidney from mice 14 days after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) surgery. RESULTS: A total of 11,391 transcriptomes were generated in the comparison phase. We identified ten clusters in the scRNA-seq dataset, but glomerular cell types were absent, and one cluster consisted primarily of artifactual dissociation-induced stress response genes. By contrast, snRNA-seq from all three platforms captured a diversity of kidney cell types that were not represented in the scRNA-seq dataset, including glomerular podocytes, mesangial cells, and endothelial cells. No stress response  genes were detected. Our snRNA-seq protocol yielded 20-fold more podocytes compared with published scRNA-seq datasets (2.4\% versus 0.12\%, respectively). Unexpectedly, single-cell and single-nucleus platforms had equivalent gene detection sensitivity. For validation, analysis of frozen day 14 UUO kidney revealed rare juxtaglomerular cells, novel activated proximal tubule and fibroblast cell states, and previously unidentified tubulointerstitial signaling  pathways. CONCLUSIONS: snRNA-seq achieves comparable gene detection to scRNA-seq  in adult kidney, and it also has substantial advantages, including reduced dissociation bias, compatibility with frozen samples, elimination of dissociation-induced transcriptional stress responses, and successful performance on inflamed fibrotic kidney.},

	abstract = {End stage kidney disease affects hundreds of thousands of patients in the United  States. The therapy of choice is kidney replacement, but availability of organs is limited, and alternative sources of tissue are needed. Generation of new kidney tissue in the laboratory has been made possible through pluripotent cell reprogramming and directed differentiation. In current procedures, aggregates of  cells known as organoids are grown either submerged or at the air-liquid interface. These studies have demonstrated that kidney tissue can be generated from pluripotent stem cells, but they also identify limitations. The first is that perfusion of cell aggregates is limited, restricting the size to which they  can be grown. The second is that aggregates lack the structural integrity required for convenient engraftment and suturing or adhesion to regions of kidney injury. In this study, we evaluated the capacity of silk to serve as a support for the growth and differentiation of kidney tissue from primary cells and from human induced pluripotent stem cells. We find that cells can differentiate to epithelia characteristic of the developing kidney on this material and that these structures are maintained following engraftment under the capsule of the adult kidney. Blood vessel investment can be promoted by the addition of vascular endothelial growth factor to the scaffold, but the proliferation of stromal cells within the graft presents a challenge, which will require some readjustment of cell growth and differentiation conditions. In summary, we find that silk can be  used to support growth of stem cell derived kidney tissue.},

Even orthotopic engraftment of organoid cultures in the adult does not provide an environment conducive to vascularization and functional differentiation. Previously, we showed that the lymph node offers an alternative transplantation site where mouse metanephroi can differentiate into mature renal structures with excretory, homeostatic, and endocrine functions. Here, we show that the lymph node lends itself well as a niche to also grow human primary kidney rudiments and can additionally be viewed  as a platform to interrogate emerging renal organoid cultures.

Morphogenetic signaling pathways reawakened during disease progression may drive  this axon remodeling. These pathways are linked to proliferative activities in prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia. However, little is known about which developmental signaling pathways guide axon investment into prostate. The first step in defining these pathways is pinpointing when axon subtypes first appear in prostate. We accomplished this by immunohistochemically mapping three axon subtypes (noradrenergic, cholinergic, and peptidergic) during fetal, neonatal, and adult stages of mouse prostate development. We devised a method for peri-prostatic axon density quantification and tested whether innervation is uniform across the proximo-distal axis of dorsal and ventral adult mouse prostate. Many axons directly interact with or innervate neuroendocrine cells in  other organs, so we examined whether sensory or autonomic axons innervate neuroendocrine cells in prostate. We first detected noradrenergic, cholinergic, and peptidergic axons in prostate at embryonic day (E) 14.5. Noradrenergic and cholinergic axon densities are uniform across the proximal-distal axis of adult mouse prostate while peptidergic axons are denser in the periurethral and proximal regions. Peptidergic and cholinergic axons are closely associated with prostate neuroendocrine cells whereas noradrenergic axons are not. These results  provide a foundation for understanding mouse prostatic axon development and organization and, provide strategies for quantifying axons during progression of  prostate disease.},

Using genetic studies in zebrafish and human embryonic stem cells, paired with in vitro cell biology and biochemistry, we determined that Wnt9a signals specifically through Fzd9b to elicit β-catenin-dependent Wnt signalling that regulates haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell emergence. We demonstrate that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is required as a cofactor for Wnt9a–Fzd9b signalling. EGFR-mediated phosphorylation of one tyrosine residue on the Fzd9b intracellular tail in response to Wnt9a promotes internalization of the Wnt9a–Fzd9b–LRP signalosome and subsequent signal transduction.

Doxycycline administration permanently labeled parietal epithelial cells with tdTomato reporter (red), and upon doxycycline removal, the parietal epithelial cells (PECs) cannot label further. Despite the presence or absence of doxycycline, podocytes cannot label with tdTomato, but are constitutively labeled with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter (green). Only activation of the Nphs1-FLPo transgene by labeled parietal epithelial cells can generate a yellow color. At day 28 of experimental focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, podocyte density was 20\% lower in 20\% of glomeruli. At day 56 of experimental focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, podocyte density was 18\% lower in 17\% of glomeruli. TdTomato+ parietal epithelial cells were restricted to Bowman?s capsule in healthy mice. However, by days 28 and 56 of experimental disease, two-thirds of tdTomato+ parietal epithelial cells within glomerular tufts were yellow in color. These cells co-expressed the podocyte markers podocin, nephrin, p57 and VEGF164, but not markers of endothelial (ERG) or mesangial (Perlecan) cells. Expansion microscopy showed primary, secondary and minor processes in tdTomato+EGFP+ cells in glomerular tufts.

	abstract = {Mobile health monitoring via non-invasive wearable sensors is poised to advance  telehealth for older adults and other vulnerable populations. Extreme heat and other  environmental conditions raise serious health challenges that warrant monitoring of  real-time physiological data as people go about their normal activities. Mobile  systems could be beneficial for many communities, including elite athletes, military  special forces, and at-home geriatric monitoring. While some commercial monitors  exist, they are bulky, require reconfiguration, and do not fit seamlessly as a  simple wearable device. We designed, prototyped and tested an integrated sensor  platform that records heart rate, oxygen saturation, physical activity levels, skin  temperature, and galvanic skin response. The device uses a small microcontroller to  integrate the measurements and store data directly on the device for up to 48+ h.  continuously. The device was compared to clinical standards for calibration and  performance benchmarking. We found that our system compared favorably with clinical  measures, such as fingertip pulse oximetry and infrared thermometry, with high  accuracy and correlation. Our novel platform would facilitate an individualized  approach to care, particularly those whose access to healthcare facilities is  limited. The platform also can be used as a research tool to study physiological  responses to a variety of environmental conditions, such as extreme heat, and can be  customized to incorporate new sensors to explore other lines of inquiry.},

However, the relative accuracy with which kidney organoids model normal morphogenesis, as well as the maturity and identity of the renal cell types they comprise, remain to be fully investigated. The authors describe the generation and validation of ten fluorescent CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited iPSC reporter lines specifically designed for the visualization, isolation, and characterization of cell types and states within kidney organoids, and demonstrate the use of these lines for cellular isolation, time-lapse imaging, protocol optimization, and lineage-tracing applications. These tools offer promise for better understanding this model system and its congruence with human kidney morphogenesis.Background The generation of reporter lines for cell identity, lineage, and physiologic state has provided a powerful tool in advancing the dissection of mouse kidney morphogenesis at a molecular level. Although use of this approach is not an option for studying human development in vivo, its application in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is now feasible.Methods We used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate ten fluorescence reporter iPSC lines designed to identify nephron progenitors, podocytes, proximal and distal nephron, and ureteric epithelium. Directed differentiation to kidney organoids was performed according to published protocols. Using immunofluorescence and live confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and cell sorting techniques, we investigated organoid patterning and reporter expression characteristics.Results Each iPSC reporter line formed well patterned kidney organoids. All reporter lines showed congruence of endogenous gene and protein expression, enabling isolation and characterization of kidney cell types of interest. We also demonstrated successful application of reporter lines for time-lapse imaging and mouse transplantation experiments.Conclusions We generated, validated, and applied a suite of fluorescence iPSC reporter lines for the study of morphogenesis within human kidney organoids.

	abstract = {Having a comprehensive transcriptional profile of the proximal tubule in health and fibrosis would likely enhance understanding of fibrosis and perhaps help explain why CKD progresses more quickly in males versus females. To obtain a more complete picture of gene expression in the proximal tubule, the authors performed deep translational profiling of this segment in a mouse model of kidney fibrosis. Their findings demonstrate substantial sex differences in transcripts expressed in proximal tubule cells of males versus females, and indicate that the proximal tubule drives fibrosis through inflammatory and profibrotic paracrine signaling. The study also identified 439 long noncoding RNAs expressed in the proximal tubule, 143 of which undergo differential regulation in fibrosis, suggesting that this type of RNA has unanticipated regulatory roles kidney fibrosis.Background Proximal tubule injury can initiate CKD, with progression rates that are approximately 50\% faster in males versus females. The precise transcriptional changes in this nephron segment during fibrosis and potential differences between sexes remain undefined.Methods We generated mice with proximal tubule–specific expression of an L10a ribosomal subunit protein fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein. We performed unilateral ureteral obstruction surgery on four male and three female mice to induce inflammation and fibrosis, collected proximal tubule–specific and bulk cortex mRNA at day 5 or 10, and sequenced samples to a depth of 30 million reads. We applied computational methods to identify sex-biased and shared molecular responses to fibrotic injury, including up- and downregulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and transcriptional regulators, and used in situ hybridization to validate critical genes and pathways.Results We identified \&gt;17,000 genes in each proximal tubule group, including 145 G-protein–coupled receptors. More than 700 transcripts were differentially expressed in the proximal tubule of males versus females. The \&gt;4000 genes displaying altered expression during fibrosis were enriched for proinflammatory and profibrotic pathways. Our identification of nearly 150 differentially expressed proximal tubule lncRNAs during fibrosis suggests they may have unanticipated regulatory roles. Network analysis prioritized proinflammatory and profibrotic transcription factors such as Irf1, Nfkb1, and Stat3 as drivers of fibrosis progression.Conclusions This comprehensive transcriptomic map of the proximal tubule revealed sexually dimorphic gene expression that may reflect sex-related disparities in CKD, proinflammatory gene modules, and previously unappreciated proximal tubule–specific bidirectional lncRNA regulation.},

	abstract = {The Salt Lake Valley has three permanent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) certified air quality monitoring stations that intake air samples and produce results of air quality pollutants in the proximity of the monitor station. Because these monitors only represent a small area of the 500-square-mile Salt Lake Valley, there are spatial gaps
when using these air qualities monitoring data for epidemiological studies. In addition to the monitoring stations, researchers as well as Salt Lake Valley residents are recording air quality measurements from their individual sensors. Systematic utilization of these vast amounts of air quality data to support translational exposomic studies necessitates
the development of a conceptual data model that harmonizes and stores air quality measurements from different sensors. A literature review using PubMed with the search criterion “Pediatric Asthma Sensor Studies’ was performed by the study team. A list of metadata elements were manually extracted from literature and a first draft of sensor
metadata specification was developed. Sample data from different sources was collected and used to evaluate the initial specification. Existing fields found in the data, but not present in the specification were added to the model. Air quality experts then reviewed the specification and modifications were made based on their inputs. The final product
is a specification that harmonizes and stores vast amounts of air quality data from different sensors. This model is being used in data integration platforms such as OpenFurther to support the study of effects of the environment (exposome) on health and well-being.},

	abstract = {Low-cost, light-scattering-based particulate matter (PM) sensors are becoming more widely available and are being increasingly deployed in ambient and indoor environments because of their low cost and ability to provide high spatial and temporal resolution PM information. Researchers have begun to evaluate some of these sensors under laboratory and environmental conditions. In this study, a low-cost, particulate matter sensor (Plantower PMS 1003/3003) used by a community air-quality network is evaluated in a controlled wind-tunnel environment and in the ambient environment during several winter-time, cold-pool events that are associated with high ambient levels of PM. In the wind-tunnel, the PMS sensor performance is compared to two research-grade, light-scattering instruments, and in the ambient tests, the sensor performance is compared to two federal equivalent (one tapered element oscillating microbalance and one beta attenuation monitor) and gravimetric federal reference methods (FEMs/FRMs) as well as one research-grade instrument (GRIMM). The PMS sensor response correlates well with research-grade instruments in the wind-tunnel tests, and its response is linear over the concentration range tested (200–850 μg/m3). In the ambient tests, this PM sensor correlates better with gravimetric methods than previous studies with correlation coefficients of 0.88. However additional measurements under a variety of ambient conditions are needed. Although the PMS sensor correlated as well as the research-grade instrument to the FRM/FEMs in ambient conditions, its response varies with particle properties to a much greater degree than the research-grade instrument. In addition, the PMS sensors overestimate ambient PM concentrations and begin to exhibit a non-linear response when PM2.5 concentrations exceed 40 μg/m3. These results have important implications for communicating results from low-cost sensor networks, and they highlight the importance of using an appropriate correction factor for the target environmental conditions if the user wants to compare the results to FEM/FRMs.},

	abstract = {Airborne particulate matter (PM) exposure exacerbates asthma and other respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. Using an indoor air purifier or furnace fan can reduce the PM concentration, however, these devices consume significant energy. We designed and built an air quality automation system called SmartAir that uses measurements from PM sensors to control a home׳s furnace fan. When PM is high, SmartAir turns on the furnace fan, pulling air through a filter to reduce the air pollutant concentration. When the PM is low, the fan is off to conserve energy. We describe an architecture we introduce to automatically perform a repeated measurement randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate SmartAir. We argue this is an appropriate scientific method to use to evaluate a variety of IoT systems that purport to improve our living conditions but whose performance is complicated by individual differences and confounding variables. We deployed SmartAir in four homes for 350 days in which each day has a randomly chosen experimental condition. The results demonstrate that SmartAir achieves air quality approximately as good as when the fan is always on (average PM2.5 = 6.13 µg/m3 SmartAir vs. 5.71 µg/m3 On) while using 58\% less energy. SmartAir also finds statistically significant lowering of PM2.5 for SmartAir vs. normal furnace fan operation. Although SmartAir increases fan on percentage, its lowering of PM2.5 can not be achieved simply by turning on the fan more often without an air quality sensor.},

In this study, a laboratory evaluation of low-cost aerosol sensors, the Dylos DC1700 and a modified Dylos known as the Utah Modified Dylos Sensor (UMDS), was performed to assess the sensors' efficiency in sampling respirable and inhalable dust at high  concentrations, which are most common in occupational settings. Dust concentrations were measured in a low-speed wind tunnel with 3 UMDSs, collocated  with an aerosol spectrometer (Grimm 1.109) and gravimetric respirable and inhalable samplers. A total of 10 tests consisting of 5 different concentrations  and 2 test aerosols, Arizona road dust and aluminum oxide, were conducted. For the Arizona road dust, total particle count was strongly related between the spectrometer and the UMDS with a coefficient of determination (R(2)) between 0.86-0.92. Particle count concentrations measured with the UMDS were converted to mass and also were related with gravimetrically collected inhalable and respirable dust. The UMDS small bin (i.e., all particles) compared to the inhalable sampler yielded an R(2) of 0.86-0.92, and the large bin subtracted from the small bin (i.e., only the smallest particles) compared to the respirable sampler yielded an R(2) of 0.93-0.997. Tests with the aluminum oxide demonstrated a substantially lower relationship across all comparisons. Furthermore, assessment of intra-instrument variability was consistent for all instruments, but inter-instrument variability indicated that each instrument requires its own  calibration equation to yield accurate exposure estimates. Overall, it appears that the UMDS can be used as a low-cost tool to estimate respirable and inhalable concentrations found in many workplaces. Future studies will focus on deployment  of a UMDS network in an occupational setting.},

	abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) has demonstrably increased rates of cardiovascular and respiratory related disease; thus, a low-cost sensor that accurately measures PM is desirable including for smaller and more private environments such as residential homes. The low-cost Dylos and the Utah Modified Dylos Sensor (UMDS) have been shown to be highly correlated with references instruments for measuring particle counts and aerosol concentrations, which makes them useful tools for air quality studies. An analytical calibration equation (calibration) is used to describe the linear relationship between the UMDS and a reference instrument, providing the best estimate of PM concentrations when the UMDS is operated. In this study, an investigation of measurement variation of a UMDS was performed using a low-cost calibration technique to determine differences between the brand new UMDS pre-calibration equation (Prec), a contaminated UMDS post-calibration equation (Postc), and a cleaned UMDS clean calibration equation (CC). The UMDS were calibrated against a high-grade aerosol spectrometer (Grimm model 1.109) as a reference instrument. Calibrations took place in a home or office environment. Counts per volume units from the UMDS were matched to the Grimm's for comparison. The investigation of the UMDS for measurement variation was performed for the approximate estimates of PM2.5 by using the small bin (i.e. ≥0.50 μm) subtracted from the large bin (i.e. ≥2.5 μm), and for total particulates by using the large bin. Linear regressions were performed between the UMDS and the Grimm per calibration event, which produced R2 values and slopes that were indicative of measurement variation. Data exceeding the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) of 106,000 particles/liter and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 4 particles/liter were excluded from statistical comparison. R2 values greater or equal to 0.70 were used to assess measurement variation as a quality control standard for valid comparisons. A rank sum statistical test between calibration comparisons was performed. Prec/Postc and Prec/CC had significant differences indicating measurement variation. Postc/CC did not have any significant differences; cleaning the UMDS had no effect and did not demonstrate measurement variation. Reasons for measurement variation may include instrument contamination (dust/dirt), hardware degradation, altered fan flow rates, and potentially inadequate cleaning of the UMDS. Future work may investigate the rate of measurement variation in order to develop a recommended re-calibration schedule in order to maintain the most accurate estimates of PM for UMDS in long-term operation.},

	abstract = {Despite mounting evidence that p53 senses and responds to physiological cues in vivo, existing knowledge regarding p53 function and target genes is largely derived from studies in cancer or stressed cells. Herein we utilize p53 transcriptome and ChIP-Seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation-high throughput sequencing) analyses to identify p53 regulated pathways in the embryonic kidney, an organ that develops via mesenchymal-epithelial interactions. This integrated approach allowed identification of novel genes that are possible direct p53 targets during kidney development. We find the p53-regulated transcriptome in the embryonic kidney is largely composed of genes regulating developmental, morphogenesis, and metabolic pathways. Surprisingly, genes in cell cycle and apoptosis pathways account for {\textless}5\% of differentially expressed transcripts. Of 7,893 p53-occupied genomic regions (peaks), the vast majority contain consensus p53 binding sites. Interestingly, 78\% of p53 peaks in the developing kidney lie within proximal promoters of annotated genes compared with 7\% in a representative cancer cell line; 25\% of the differentially expressed p53-bound genes are present in nephron progenitors and nascent nephrons, including key transcriptional regulators, components of Fgf, Wnt, Bmp, and Notch pathways, and ciliogenesis genes. The results indicate widespread p53 binding to the genome in vivo and context-dependent differences in the p53 regulon between cancer, stress, and development. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of the p53 transcriptome and cistrome in a developing mammalian organ, substantiating the role of p53 as a bona fide developmental regulator. We conclude p53 targets transcriptional networks regulating nephrogenesis and cellular metabolism during kidney development.},

For example, single-cell RNA sequencing technologies are producing expression and sequence information from tens of thousands of cells in every single experiment. A common task in analyzing biological data is to cluster samples or features (e.g. genes) into groups sharing common characteristics. This is an NP hard problem for which numerous heuristic algorithms have been developed. However, in many cases, the clusters created by these algorithms do not reflect biological reality. To overcome this, a Networks Based Clustering (NBC) approach was recently proposed, by which the samples or genes in the dataset are first mapped to a network and then community detection (CD) algorithms are used to identify clusters of nodes. Here, we created an open and flexible python-based toolkit for NBC that enables easy and accessible network construction and community detection. We then tested the applicability of NBC for identifying clusters of cells or genes from previously published large-scale single-cell and bulk RNA-seq datasets. We show that NBC can be used to accurately and efficiently analyze large-scale datasets of RNA sequencing experiments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We developed a mouse model of urogenital schistosomiasis through intramural injection of parasite eggs into the bladder wall to mimic the trapping of parasite eggs in the bladder. This approach recapitulates many of the sequelae observed in infected humans. Here, we describe procedures for utilizing this surgical technique in combination with well-established transgenic mouse strains to dissect the role of cancer-related genes in the initiation and establishment of bladder carcinogenesis. The described method utilizes CRE-mediated flox activity to render mice p53 haploinsufficient before challenging them with bladder wall egg injection. These techniques are potentially amenable to studying the role of other pro-carcinogenic and cancer suppressor gene(s) in urogenital schistosomiasis-associated urothelial carcinogenesis.},

The bladder requires a healthy mature nervous system to store urine and release it at behaviourally appropriate times. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the construction of these neural circuits is not only relevant to defining the basis of developmental problems but may also suggest strategies to restore connectivity and function following injury or disease in adults. The bladder nerve supply comprises multiple classes of sensory, and parasympathetic or sympathetic autonomic effector (motor) neurons. First, we define the developmental endpoint by describing this circuitry in adult rodents. Next we discuss the innervation of the developing bladder, identifying challenges posed by this area of research.

	abstract = {Introduction and Objective
The bladder urothelium changes dramatically during Schistosoma haematobium infection (urogenital schistosomiasis). These alterations include hyperplasia, ulceration, dysplasia, squamous metaplasia and frank carcinogenesis. Defining the pathways underpinning these urothelial responses will contribute to a deeper understanding of how S. haematobium egg expulsion, hematuria, and bladder cancer develop in humans. The tumor suppressor gene p53 is of particular interest, given its role in many cancers, including bladder cancer generally and schistosomal bladder cancer specifically.
Methods
Transgenic mice featuring tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase activity in cells expressing the urothelial-specific gene uroplakin-3a (Upk3a-GCE mice) were crossed with either TdTomato-floxed-EGFP reporter or p53-floxed mice. Mice were administered tamoxifen or vehicle control to induce excision of floxed genes. TdTomato-EGFP reporter mice were sacrificed and their bladders harvested, sectioned, and imaged by fluorescence microscopy. p53-floxed mice underwent bladder wall injection with S. haematobium eggs or vehicle controls. Three months later, mice were sacrificed and their bladders subjected to histological analysis (H\&E staining).
Results
We first confirmed the phenotypic fidelity of Upk3a-GCE mice by crossing them with TdTomato-floxed-EGFP reporter mice and administering tamoxifen to their progeny. As expected, these progeny switched from TdTomato to EGFP expression in their bladder urothelium. Having confirmed the phenotype of Upk3a-GCE mice, we next crossed them to p53-floxed mice. The resulting progeny were given tamoxifen or vehicle control to render them urothelial p53-haploinsufficient or -intact, respectively. Then, we injected S. haematobium eggs or control vehicle into the bladder walls of these mice. Male p53-intact, egg-injected mice exhibited similar histological changes as their p53-haploinsufficient counterparts, including urothelial hyperplasia and ulceration. In contrast, female p53-intact, egg-injected mice featured no urothelial ulceration, whereas their p53-haploinsufficient counterparts often had significant ulceration.
Conclusions
Urothelial p53 signaling indeed seems to affect urothelial homeostasis during S. haematobium infection, albeit in a sex-specific manner. Ongoing work seeks to determine whether p53 mediates associated alterations in urothelial cell cycle status and frank carcinogenesis in the setting of urogenital schistosomiasis.},

Renal dysplasia is classically described as a developmental disorder whereby the kidneys fail to undergo appropriate differentiation, resulting in the presence of malformed renal tissue elements. It is the commonest cause of chronic kidney disease and renal failure in the neonate. While several genes have been identified in association with renal dysplasia, the underlying molecular mechanisms are often complex and heterogeneous in nature and remain poorly understood.

Recent findings
In this review, we describe new insights into the fundamental process of normal kidney development, and how the renal cortex and medulla are patterned appropriately during gestation. We review the key genes that are indispensable for this process, and discuss how patterning of the kidney is perturbed in the absence of these signaling pathways. The recent use of whole exome sequencing has identified genetic mutations in patients with renal dysplasia, and the results of these studies have increased our understanding of the pathophysiology of renal dysplasia.

Summary
At present, there are no specific treatments available for patients with renal dysplasia. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of normal kidney development and the pathogenesis of renal dysplasia may allow for improved therapeutic options for these patients.},

	abstract = {The mammalian kidney is derived from progenitor cells in intermediate mesoderm. During embryogenesis, progenitor cells expressing the Wilms tumor suppressor gene, WT1, are induced to differentiate in response to WNT signals from the ureteric bud. In hereditary Wilms tumors, clonal loss of WT1 precludes the β-catenin pathway response and leads to precancerous nephrogenic rests. We hypothesized that WT1 normally primes progenitor cells for differentiation by suppressing the enhancer of zeste2 gene (EZH2), involved in epigenetic silencing of differentiation genes. In human amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells, we show that exogenous WT1B represses EZH2 transcription. This leads to a dramatic decrease in the repressive lysine 27 trimethylation mark on histone H3 that silences β-catenin gene expression. As a result, amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells acquire responsiveness to WNT9b and increase expression of genes that mark the onset of nephron differentiation. Our observations suggest that biallelic loss of WT1 sustains the inhibitory histone methylation state that characterizes Wilms tumors.},

Wilms' tumours, paediatric kidney cancers, are the archetypal example of tumours caused through the disruption of normal development. The genetically best-defined subgroup of Wilms' tumours is the group caused by biallelic loss of the WT1 tumour suppressor gene. Here, we describe a developmental series of mouse models with conditional loss of Wt1 in different stages of nephron development before and after the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). We demonstrate that Wt1 is essential for normal development at all kidney developmental stages under study. Comparison of genome-wide expression data from the mutant mouse models with human tumour material of mutant or wild-type WT1 datasets identified the stage of origin of human WT1-mutant tumours, and emphasizes fundamental differences between the two human tumour groups due to different developmental stages of origin.},

	abstract = {Prune belly syndrome (PBS), also known as Eagle-Barrett syndrome, is a rare congenital disorder characterized by absence or hypoplasia of the abdominal wall musculature, urinary tract anomalies, and cryptorchidism in males. The etiology of PBS is largely unresolved, but genetic factors are implicated given its recurrence in families. We examined cases of PBS to identify novel pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs). A total of 34 cases (30 males and 4 females) with PBS identified from all live births in New York State (1998–2005) were genotyped using Illumina HumanOmni2.5 microarrays. CNVs were prioritized if they were absent from in-house controls, encompassed ≥10 consecutive probes, were ≥20 Kb in size, had ≤20\% overlap with common variants in population reference controls, and had ≤20\% overlap with any variant previously detected in other birth defect phenotypes screened in our laboratory. We identified 17 candidate autosomal CNVs; 10 cases each had one CNV and four cases each had two CNVs. The CNVs included a 158 Kb duplication at 4q22 that overlaps the BMPR1B gene; duplications of different sizes carried by two cases in the intron of STIM1 gene; a 67 Kb duplication 202 Kb downstream of the NOG gene, and a 1.34 Mb deletion including the MYOCD gene. The identified rare CNVs spanned genes involved in mesodermal, muscle, and urinary tract development and differentiation, which might help in elucidating the genetic contribution to PBS. We did not have parental DNA and cannot identify whether these CNVs were de novo or inherited. Further research on these CNVs, particularly BMP signaling is warranted to elucidate the pathogenesis of PBS.},

Here we performed 2-D gel-based comparative proteome analyses of rat embryonic kidney from different developmental stages. Out of 288 non-redundant identified proteins, 102 were common in all developmental stages. 86\% of the proteins found in E14 and E16 were identical, in contrast only 37\% of the identified proteins overlap between E14 and P1. Bioinformatics analysis suggests developmental stage-specific pathway activation and highlighted heterochromatin protein 1 (Cbx1, Cbx3, Cbx5) and Trim28 as potential key players in nephrogenesis. These are involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene silencing and were down-regulated in the course of kidney development. Trim28 is a potential epigenetic regulator of the branching inhibitor Bmp4. Silencing of Trim28 in cultured kidneys resulted in branching arrest. In contrast knockdown of Cbx5 was associated with abnormal ureteric bud growth and slight impairment of branching. ChIP analysis showed that the H3K9me3 distribution on Bmp4 promoters at E14 and E19 inversely correlate with mRNA expression levels. The concentrated expression-pattern of heterochromatin proteins and the negative impact of their silencing on kidney development, suggest an important role in reciprocal and inductive signaling between the ureteric bud and the metanephric mesenchyme.},

Studies using the megabladder (mgb −/− ) model of CKD show that renal urothelium plays a key role in modulating early injury responses following the development of congenital obstruction. The aim of this review is to examine the role that urothelium has in normal urinary tract development and pathogenesis. We discuss normal morphology of renal urothelium and then examine the role that uroplakins (Upks) play in its development. Histologic, biochemical, and molecular characterization of Upk1b RFP/RFP mice indicated Upk1b expression is essential for normal urinary tract development, apical plaque/asymmetric membrane unit (AUM) formation, and differentiation and functional integrity of the renal urothelium. Our studies provide the first evidence that Upk1b is directly associated with the development of congenital anomalies of the urinary tract (CAKUT), spontaneous age-dependent hydronephrosis, and dysplastic urothelia. These observations demonstrate the importance of proper urothelial differentiation in normal development and pathogenesis of the urinary tract and provide a unique working model to test the hypothesis that the complex etiology associated with CKD is dependent upon predetermined genetic susceptibilities that establish pathogenic thresholds for disease initiation and progression.},

An important part of the renal filtration barrier is composed of podocytes with their actin-rich foot processes. In this study, we used stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to mass spectrometry to characterize relative changes in the phosphoproteome of human podocytes in response to short-term treatment with AngII. In 4 replicates, we identified a total of 17,956 peptides that were traceable to 2081 distinct proteins. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that among the increasingly phosphorylated peptides are predominantly peptides that are related to actin filaments, cytoskeleton, lamellipodia, mammalian target of rapamycin, and MAPK signaling. Among others, this screening approach highlighted the increased phosphorylation of actin-bundling protein, l-plastin (LCP1). AngII-dependent phosphorylation of LCP1 in cultured podocytes was mediated by the kinases ERK, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase, PKA, or PKC. LCP1 phosphorylation increased filopodia formation. In addition, treatment with AngII led to LCP1 redistribution to the cell margins, membrane ruffling, and formation of lamellipodia. Our data highlight the importance of AngII-triggered actin cytoskeleton-associated signal transduction in podocytes.—Schenk, L.

The performance of these activities depends on the development of specific cell types in a precise temporal and spatial pattern, to produce a sufficient number of nephrons. Over the past several decades, considerable advances have been made in understanding the molecular basis for this developmental program. Defects in this program result in congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, which are the leading causes of chronic kidney disease and renal failure in children. These developmental disorders range from renal malformations, such as renal aplasia (absence of the kidney), dysplasia (failure of normal renal differentiation), and hypoplasia (smaller kidneys), to urinary tract abnormalities such as vesicoureteral reflux and duplicated collecting systems. This chapter describes the embryology of the kidney and urinary tract, as a means to understand the developmental origins of these disorders.},

Wilms' tumours, paediatric kidney cancers, are the archetypal example of tumours caused through the disruption of normal development. The genetically best-defined subgroup of Wilms' tumours is the group caused by biallelic loss of the WT1 tumour suppressor gene. Here, we describe a developmental series of mouse models with conditional loss of Wt1 in different stages of nephron development before and after the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). We demonstrate that Wt1 is essential for normal development at all kidney developmental stages under study. Comparison of genome-wide expression data from the mutant mouse models with human tumour material of mutant or wild-type WT1 datasets identified the stage of origin of human WT1-mutant tumours, and emphasizes fundamental differences between the two human tumour groups due to different developmental stages of origin.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate mRNA levels. While previous studies have demonstrated that miRNAs are indispensable in the nephron progenitor and ureteric bud lineage, little is understood about stromal miRNAs during kidney development. The renal stroma (marked by expression of FoxD1) gives rise to the renal interstitium, a subset of peritubular capillaries, and multiple supportive vascular cell types including pericytes and the glomerular mesangium. In this study, we generated FoxD1GC;Dicerfl/fl transgenic mice that lack miRNA biogenesis in the FoxD1 lineage. Loss of Dicer activity resulted in multifaceted renal anomalies including perturbed nephrogenesis, expansion of nephron progenitors, decreased renin-expressing cells, fewer smooth muscle afferent arterioles, and progressive mesangial cell loss in mature glomeruli. Although the initial lineage specification of FoxD1+ stroma was not perturbed, both the glomerular mesangium and renal interstitium exhibited ectopic apoptosis, which was associated with increased expression of Bcl2l11 (Bim) and p53 effector genes (Bax, Trp53inp1, Jun, Cdkn1a, Mmp2, and Arid3a). Using a combination of high-throughput miRNA profiling of the FoxD1+-derived cells and mRNA profiling of differentially expressed transcripts in FoxD1GC;Dicerfl/fl kidneys, at least 72 miRNA:mRNA target interactions were identified to be suppressive of the apoptotic program. Together, the results support an indispensable role for stromal miRNAs in the regulation of apoptosis during kidney development.},

	abstract = {The prorenin receptor (PRR) is a receptor for renin and prorenin, and an accessory subunit of the vacuolar proton pump H+-ATPase. Renal branching morphogenesis, defined as growth and branching of the ureteric bud (UB), is essential for mammalian kidney development. Previously, we demonstrated that conditional ablation of the PRR in the UB in PRRUB−/− mice causes severe defects in UB branching, resulting in marked kidney hypoplasia at birth. Here, we investigated the UB transcriptome using whole genome-based analysis of gene expression in UB cells, FACS-isolated from PRRUB−/−, and control kidneys at birth (P0) to determine the primary role of the PRR in terminal differentiation and growth of UB-derived collecting ducts. Three genes with expression in UB cells that previously shown to regulate UB branching morphogenesis, including Wnt9b, β-catenin, and Fgfr2, were upregulated, whereas the expression of Wnt11, Bmp7, Etv4, and Gfrα1 was downregulated. We next demonstrated that infection of immortalized UB cells with shPRR in vitro or deletion of the UB PRR in double-transgenic PRRUB−/−/BatGal+ mice, a reporter strain for β-catenin transcriptional activity, in vivo increases β-catenin activity in the UB epithelia. In addition to UB morphogenetic genes, the functional groups of differentially expressed genes within the downregulated gene set included genes involved in molecular transport, metabolic disease, amino acid metabolism, and energy production. Together, these data demonstrate that UB PRR performs essential functions during UB branching and collecting duct morphogenesis via control of a hierarchy of genes that control UB branching and terminal differentiation of the collecting duct cells.},

Here, we report that newborn pups with a heterozygous null mutation in Osr1 exhibit a 21\% incidence of vesicoureteric reflux and have hydronephrosis and urinary tract duplications. Newborn pups have a short intravesical ureter, resulting in a less competent ureterovesical junction which arises from a delay in urinary tract development. We describe a new domain of Osr1 expression in the ureteral mesenchyme and within the developing bladder in the mouse. OSR1 was sequenced in 186 children with primary vesicoureteric reflux, and 17 have single nucleotide polymorphisms. Fifteen children have a common synonymous variant, rs12329305, one child has a rare nonsynonymous variant, rs3440471, and one child has a rare 5′-UTR variant, rs45535040. The impact of these SNPs is not clear; therefore, the role of OSR1 in human disease remains to be elucidated. Osr1 is a candidate gene implicated in the pathogenesis of vesicoureteric reflux and congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract in mice.},

We demonstrate that Endoglycan, a CD34 family member with homology to Podocalyxin, is produced prior to lumen formation in developing nephrons. Endoglycan localizes to Rab11-containing vesicles in nephron progenitors, and then relocalizes to the apical surface as progenitors epithelialize. Once an apical/luminal surface is formed, Endoglycan (and the actin-binding protein Ezrin) localize to large, intraluminal structures that may be vesicles/exosomes. We generated mice lacking Endoglycan and found mutants had timely initiation of lumen formation and continuous lumens, similar to controls. Mice with conditional deletion of both Endoglycan and Podocalyxin in developing nephrons also had normal tubular lumens. Despite this, Endoglycan/Podocalyxin is required for apical recruitment of the adaptor protein NHERF1, but not Ezrin, in podocyte precursors, a subset of the epithelia. In summary, while CD34 family members appear dispensable for lumen formation, our data identify Endoglycan as a novel pre-luminal marker and suggest lumen formation occurs via vesicular trafficking of apical cargo that includes Endoglycan.},

Current medical treatments are unable to ameliorate the dire consequences of nephron deficit or injury. Although there have been tremendous advancements in our understanding of nephron ontogeny and the response to damage, many significant knowledge gaps still remain. The zebrafish embryo kidney, or pronephros, is an ideal model for many renal development and regeneration studies because it is comprised of nephrons that share conserved features with the nephron units that comprise the mammalian metanephric kidney. In this chapter, we provide an overview about the benefits of using the zebrafish pronephros to study the mechanisms underlying nephrogen- esis as well as epithelial repair and regeneration. We subsequently detail methods for the spatiotemporal assessment of gene and protein expression in zebrafish embryos that can be used to extend the understanding of nephron development and disease, and thereby create new opportunities to identify therapeutic strategies for regenerative medicine.},

	abstract = {Background: Abnormalities in ureteric bud (UB) branching morphogenesis lead to congenital anomalies of the kidney and reduced nephron numbers associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension. Previous studies showed that the epithelial fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (Fgfr2) IIIb splice variant supports ureteric morphogenesis in response to ligands from the metanephric mesenchyme during renal organogenesis. The epithelial-specific splicing regulator Esrp1 is required for expression of Fgfr2-IIIb and other epithelial-specific splice variants. Our objective was to determine whether Esrp1 is required for normal kidney development. Results: Ablation of Esrp1 in mice, alone or together with its paralog Esrp2, was associated with reduced kidney size and increased incidence of renal aplasia. Three-dimensional imaging showed that embryonic Esrp1 knockout (KO) kidneys had fewer ureteric tips and reduced nephron numbers. Analysis of alternative splicing in Esrp-null ureteric epithelial cells by RNA-Seq confirmed a splicing switch in Fgfr2 as well as numerous other transcripts. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that Esrp1-regulated splicing in ureteric epithelial cells plays an important role in renal development. Defects in Esrp1 KO kidneys likely reflect reduced and/or absent ureteric branching, leading to decreased nephron induction secondary to incorrect Fgfr2 splicing and other splicing alterations.

The mice and the bacterial artificial chromosome transgenes are available from repositories (MMRRC or CHORI), thereby making these resources readily available to the research community. This resource of 1,386 transgenic lines was developed and validated for neuroscience research. However, GENSAT mice have many potential applications in other contexts including studies of development outside of the CNS. The cell type-specific expression of fluorescent proteins in these mice has been used to identify cells in living embryos, in living embryo explants, and in stem or progenitor cell populations in postnatal tissues. The large number of fluorescent protein driver lines generated by GENSAT greatly expands the range of cell type markers that can be used for live cell sorting. In addition, the GENSAT project has generated 278 new Cre driver lines. This review provides an overview of the GENSAT lines and information for identifying lines that may be useful for a particular application. I also provide a review of the few published cases in which GENSAT mice have been used for studies of embryonic development or analysis of stem/progenitor cells in nonneural tissues. genesis 54:245–256, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Wilms tumour (WT) is an embryonal tumour that recapitulates kidney development. The normal kidney is formed from two distinct embryological origins: the metanephric mesenchyme (MM) and the ureteric bud (UB). It is generally accepted that WT arises from precursor cells in the MM; however whether UB-equivalent structures participate in tumorigenesis is uncertain. To address the question of the involvement of UB, we assessed 55 Wilms tumours for the molecular features of MM and UB using gene expression profiling, immunohistochemsitry and immunofluorescence. Expression profiling primarily based on the Genitourinary Molecular Anatomy Project data identified molecular signatures of the UB and collecting duct as well as those of the proximal and distal tubules in the triphasic histology group. We performed immunolabeling for fetal kidneys and WTs. We focused on a central epithelial blastema pattern which is the characteristic of triphasic histology characterized by UB-like epithelial structures surrounded by MM and MM-derived epithelial structures, evoking the induction/aggregation phase of the developing kidney. The UB-like epithelial structures and surrounding MM and epithelial structures resembling early glomerular epithelium, proximal and distal tubules showed similar expression patterns to those of the developing kidney. These observations indicate WTs can arise from a precursor cell capable of generating the entire kidney, such as the cells of the intermediate mesoderm from which both the MM and UB are derived. Moreover, this provides an explanation for the variable histological features of mesenchymal to epithelial differentiation seen in WT.},

The prorenin receptor (PRR) is a receptor for renin and prorenin, and an accessory subunit of the vacuolar proton pump V-ATPase. Previously, we demonstrated that conditional ablation of the PRR in Six2+ NPCs in mice (Six2PRR−/−) causes early neonatal death. Here, we identified genes that are regulated by PRR in Six2+ NPCs FACS-isolated from Six2PRR−/− and control kidneys on embryonic day E15.5 using whole-genome expression analysis. Seven genes with expression in CM cells previously shown to direct kidney development, including Notch1, β-catenin, Lef1, Lhx1, Jag1, and p53, were downregulated. The functional groups within the downregulated gene set included genes involved in embryonic and cellular development, renal regeneration, cellular assembly and organization, cell morphology, death and survival. Double-transgenic Six2PRR−/−/BatGal+ mice, a reporter strain for β-catenin transcriptional activity, showed decreased β-catenin activity in the UB in vivo. Reduced PRR gene dosage in heterozygous Six2PRR+/− mice was associated with decreased glomerular number, segmental thickening of the glomerular basement membrane with focal podocyte foot process effacement, development of hypertension and increased soluble PRR (sPRR) levels in the urine at 2 months of age. Together, these data demonstrate that NPC PRR performs essential functions during nephrogenesis via control of hierarchy of genes that regulate critical cellular processes. Both reduced nephron endowment and augmented urine sPRR likely contribute to programming of hypertension in Six2PRR+/− mice.},

	abstract = {Epigenetic modulation of podocyte injury plays a pivotal role in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Wilm's tumor 1 (WT1) has been found to have opposing roles with β-catenin in podocyte biology. Herein, we asked whether the histone methyltransferase enzyme enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) promotes WT1-induced podocyte injury via β-catenin activation and the underlying mechanisms. We found that WT1 antagonized EZH2 and ameliorated β-catenin-mediated podocyte injury as demonstrated by attenuated podocyte mesenchymal transition, maintenance of podocyte architectural integrity, decreased podocyte apoptosis and oxidative stress. Further, we provided mechanistical evidence that EZH2 was required in WT1-mediated β-catenin inactivation via repression of secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP-1), a Wnt antagonist. Moreover, EZH2-mediated silencing of SFRP-1 was due to increased histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) on its promoter region. WT1 favored renal function and decreased podocyte injury in diabetic rats and DN patients. Notably, WT1 exhibited clinical and biological relevance as it was linked to dropped serum creatinine, decreased proteinuria and elevated estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). We propose an epigenetic process via the WT1/EZH2/β-catenin axis in attenuating podocyte injury in DN. Targeting WT1 and EZH2 could be potential therapeutic approaches for DN.},

	abstract = {Prostate autonomic and sensory axons control glandular growth, fluid secretion, and smooth muscle contraction and are remodeled during cancer and inflammation. Morphogenetic signaling pathways reawakened during disease progression may drive this axon remodeling. These pathways are linked to proliferative activities in prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia. However, little is known about which developmental signaling pathways guide axon investment into prostate. The first step in defining these pathways is pinpointing when axon subtypes first appear in prostate. We accomplished this by immunohistochemically mapping three axon subtypes (noradrenergic, cholinergic, and peptidergic) during fetal, neonatal, and adult stages of mouse prostate development. We devised a method for peri-prostatic axon density quantification and tested whether innervation is uniform across the proximo–distal axis of dorsal and ventral adult mouse prostate. Many axons directly interact with or innervate neuroendocrine cells in other organs, so we examined whether sensory or autonomic axons innervate neuroendocrine cells in prostate. We first detected noradrenergic, cholinergic, and peptidergic axons in prostate at embryonic day (E) 14.5. Noradrenergic and cholinergic axon densities are uniform across the proximal–distal axis of adult mouse prostate while peptidergic axons are denser in the periurethral and proximal regions. Peptidergic and cholinergic axons are closely associated with prostate neuroendocrine cells whereas noradrenergic axons are not. These results provide a foundation for understanding mouse prostatic axon development and organization and, provide strategies for quantifying axons during progression of prostate disease.},

	abstract = {There is a global epidemic of chronic kidney disease (CKD) characterized by a progressive loss of nephrons, ascribed in large part to a rising incidence of hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. There is a ten-fold variation in nephron number at birth in the general population, and a 50\% overall decrease in nephron number in the last decades of life. The vicious cycle of nephron loss stimulating hypertrophy by remaining nephrons and resulting in glomerulosclerosis has been regarded as maladaptive, and only partially responsive to angiotensin inhibition. Advances over the past century in kidney physiology, genetics, and development have elucidated many aspects of nephron formation, structure and function. Parallel advances have been achieved in evolutionary biology, with the emergence of evolutionary medicine, a discipline that promises to provide new insight into the treatment of chronic disease. This review provides a framework for understanding the origins of contemporary developmental nephrology, and recent progress in evolutionary biology. The establishment of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo), ecological developmental biology (eco-devo), and developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) followed the discovery of the hox gene family, the recognition of the contribution of cumulative environmental stressors to the changing phenotype over the life cycle, and mechanisms of epigenetic regulation. The maturation of evolutionary medicine has contributed to new investigative approaches to cardiovascular disease, cancer, and infectious disease, and promises the same for CKD. By incorporating these principles, developmental nephrology is ideally positioned to answer important questions regarding the fate of nephrons from embryo through senescence.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms that establish nephron segments are poorly understood. The zebrafish embryonic kidney, or pronephros, is a simplified yet conserved genetic model to study this renal development process because its nephrons contain segments akin to other vertebrates, including the proximal convoluted and straight tubules (PCT, PST). The zebrafish pronephros is also associated with the corpuscles of Stannius (CS), endocrine glands that regulate calcium and phosphate homeostasis, but whose ontogeny from renal progenitors is largely mysterious. Initial patterning of zebrafish renal progenitors in the intermediate mesoderm (IM) involves the formation of rostral and caudal domains, the former being reliant on retinoic acid (RA) signaling, and the latter being repressed by elevated RA levels. Here, using expression profiling to gain new insights into nephrogenesis, we discovered that the gene single minded family bHLH transcription factor 1a (sim1a) is dynamically expressed in the renal progenitors—first marking the caudal domain, then becoming restricted to the proximal segments, and finally exhibiting specific CS expression. In loss of function studies, sim1a knockdown expanded the PCT and abrogated both the PST and CS populations. Conversely, overexpression of sim1a modestly expanded the PST and CS, while it reduced the PCT. These results show that sim1a activity is necessary and partially sufficient to induce PST and CS fates, and suggest that sim1a may inhibit PCT fate and/or negotiate the PCT/PST boundary. Interestingly, the sim1a expression domain in renal progenitors is responsive to altered levels of RA, suggesting that RA regulates sim1a, directly or indirectly, during nephrogenesis. sim1a deficient embryos treated with exogenous RA formed nephrons that were predominantly composed of PCT segments, but lacked the enlarged PST observed in RA treated wild-types, indicating that RA is not sufficient to rescue the PST in the absence of sim1a expression. Alternately, when sim1a knockdowns were exposed to the RA inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB), the CS was abrogated rather than expanded as seen in DEAB treated wild-types, revealing that CS formation in the absence of sim1a cannot be rescued by RA biosynthesis abrogation. Taken together, these data reveal previously unappreciated roles for sim1a in zebrafish pronephric proximal tubule and CS patterning, and are consistent with the model that sim1a acts downstream of RA to mitigate the formation of these lineages. These findings provide new insights into the genetic pathways that direct nephron development, and may have implications for understanding renal birth defects and kidney reprogramming.},

Human pluripotent stem cells, after directed differentiation in vitro, can spontaneously generate complex tissues via self-organisation of the component cells. Self-organisation can also reform embryonic organ structure after tissue disruption. It has previously been demonstrated that dissociated embryonic kidneys can recreate component epithelial and mesenchymal relationships sufficient to allow continued kidney morphogenesis. Here, we investigate the timing and underlying mechanisms driving self-organisation after dissociation of the embryonic kidney using time-lapse imaging, high-resolution confocal analyses and mathematical modelling. Organotypic self-organisation sufficient for nephron initiation was observed within a 24 h period. This involved cell movement, with structure emerging after the clustering of ureteric epithelial cells, a process consistent with models of random cell movement with preferential cell adhesion. Ureteric epithelialisation rapidly followed the formation of ureteric cell clusters with the reformation of nephron-forming niches representing a later event. Disruption of P-cadherin interactions was seen to impair this ureteric epithelial cell clustering without affecting epithelial maturation. This understanding could facilitate improved regulation of patterning within organoids and facilitate kidney engineering approaches guided by cell-cell self-organisation.},

A comprehensive cellular anatomy of normal human prostate is essential for solving the cellular origins of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.

Immunohistochemistry with newly derived cell type-specific markers revealed the distribution of each epithelial and stromal cell type on whole mounts, revising our understanding of zonal anatomy. Based on discovered cell surface markers, flow cytometry antibody panels were designed to improve the purification of each cell type, with each gate confirmed by scRNA-seq. The molecular classification, anatomical distribution, and purification tools for each cell type in the human prostate create a powerful resource for experimental design in human prostate disease.},

	abstract = {The Wilms’ tumor suppressor WT1 is a key regulator of podocyte function that is mutated in Denys–Drash and Frasier syndromes. Here we have used an integrative approach employing ChIP, exon array, and genetic analyses in mice to address general and isoform-specific functions of WT1 in podocyte differentiation. Analysis of ChIP-Seq data showed that almost half of the podocyte-specific genes are direct targets of WT1. Bioinformatic analysis further identified coactivator FOXC1-binding sites in proximity to WT1-bound regions, thus supporting coordinated action of these transcription factors in regulating podocyte-specific genes. Transcriptional profiling of mice lacking the WT1 alternative splice isoform (+KTS) had a more restrictive set of genes whose expression depends on these alternatively spliced isoforms. One of these genes encodes the membrane-associated guanylate kinase MAGI2, a protein that localizes to the base of the slit diaphragm. Using functional analysis in mice, we further show that MAGI2α is essential for proper localization of nephrin and the assembly of the slit diaphragm complex. Finally, a dramatic reduction of MAGI2 was found in an LPS mouse model of glomerular injury and in genetic cases of human disease. Thus, our study highlights the central role of WT1 in podocyte differentiation, identifies that WT1 has a central role in podocyte differentiation, and identifies MAGI2α as the crucial isoform in slit diaphragm assembly, suggesting a causative role of this gene in the etiology of glomerular disorders.},

Embryonic kidney re-aggregation in vitro assays have been established which allow for the monitoring of organotypic cell behaviour in re-aggregated and chimeric renal organoids. However, evaluation of cell integration is hampered by the high photonic load of standard fluorescence microscopy which poses challenges for imaging three-dimensional systems in real-time over a time course. Therefore, we employed light sheet microscopy, a technique that vastly reduces photobleaching and phototoxic effects. We have also developed a new method for culturing the re-aggregates which involves immersed culture, generating organoids which more closely reflect development in vivo. To facilitate imaging from various angles, we embedded the organoids in a freely rotatable hydrogel cylinder. Endpoint fixing and staining were performed to provide additional biomolecular information. We succeeded in imaging labelled cells within re-aggregated kidney organoids over 15 hours and tracking their fate while simultaneously monitoring the development of organotypic morphological structures. Our results show that Wt1-expressing embryonic kidney cells obtained from transgenic mice could integrate into re-aggregated chimeric kidney organoids and contribute to developing nephrons. Furthermore, the nascent proximal tubules that formed in the re-aggregated tissues using the new culture method displayed secretory function, as evidenced by their ability to secrete an organic anion mimic into the tubular lumen.},

	abstract = {Cell subtype proportion variability between samples contributes significantly to the variation of functional genomic properties such as gene expression or DNA methylation. Although the impact of the variation of cell subtype composition on measured genomic quantities is recognized, and some innovative tools have been developed for the analysis of heterogeneous samples, most functional genomics studies using samples with mixed cell types still ignore the influence of cell subtype proportion variation, or just deal with it as a nuisance variable to be eliminated. Here we demonstrate how harvesting information about cell subtype proportions from functional genomics data can provide insights into cellular changes associated with phenotypes. We focused on two types of mixed cell populations, human blood and mouse kidney. Cell type prediction is well developed in the former, but not currently in the latter. Estimating the cellular repertoire is easier when a reference dataset from purified samples of all cell types in the tissue is available, as is the case for blood. However, reference datasets are not available for most other tissues, such as the kidney. In this study, we showed that the proportion of alterations attributable to changes in the cellular composition varies strikingly in the two disorders (asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus), suggesting that the contribution of cell subtype proportion changes to functional genomic properties can be disease-specific. We also showed that a reference dataset from a single-cell RNA-seq study successfully estimated the cell subtype proportions in mouse kidney and allowed us to distinguish altered cell subtype differences between two different knock-out mouse models, both of which had reported a reduced number of glomeruli compared to their wild-type counterparts. These findings demonstrate that testing for changes in cell subtype proportions between conditions can yield important insights in functional genomics studies.},

We have used immunofluorescence and time-lapse calcium imaging of cultured explanted embryonic rat kidneys to study the role of calcium signaling for branching morphogenesis. In mesenchymal cells, we recorded spontaneous calcium activity that was characterized by irregular calcium transients. The calcium signals were dependent on release of calcium from intracellular stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. Down-regulation of the calcium activity, both by blocking the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and by chelating cytosolic calcium, resulted in retardation of branching morphogenesis and a reduced formation of primitive nephrons but had no effect on cell proliferation. We propose that spontaneous calcium activity contributes with a stochastic factor to the self-organizing process that controls branching morphogenesis, a major determinant of the ultimate number of nephrons in the kidney.—Fontana, J.

Previously, we demonstrated a requirement for Ilk during ureteric branching and cell cycle regulation in collecting duct cells in vivo. Although in vitro data indicate that ILK controls p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) activity, the contribution of ILK-p38MAPK signaling to branching morphogenesis in vivo is not defined. Here, we identified genes that are regulated by Ilk in ureteric cells using a whole-genome expression analysis of whole-kidney mRNA in mice with Ilk deficiency in the ureteric cell lineage. Six genes with expression in ureteric tip cells, including Wnt11, were downregulated, whereas the expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 8 (DUSP8) was upregulated. Phosphorylation of p38MAPK was decreased in kidney tissue with Ilk deficiency, but no significant decrease in the phosphorylation of other intracellular effectors previously shown to control renal morphogenesis was observed. Pharmacologic inhibition of p38MAPK activity in murine inner medullary collecting duct 3 (mIMCD3) cells decreased expression of Wnt11, Krt23, and Slo4c1. DUSP8 overexpression in mIMCD3 cells significantly inhibited p38MAPK activation and the expression of Wnt11 and Slo4c1. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of DUSP8 in cultured embryonic murine kidneys decreased ureteric branching and p38MAPK activation. Together, these data demonstrate that Ilk controls branching morphogenesis by regulating the expression of DUSP8, which inhibits p38MAPK activity and decreases branching morphogenesis.},

However, the molecular processes regulating normal papillary outgrowth during the postnatal period are unclear. In this study, transcriptional profiling of the renal medulla across postnatal development revealed enrichment of non-canonical Wnt signalling, vascular development, and planar cell polarity genes, all of which may contribute to perinatal medulla/papilla maturation. These pathways were investigated in a model of papillary hypoplasia with functional obstruction, the Crim1KST264/KST264 transgenic mouse. Postnatal elongation of the renal papilla via convergent extension was unaffected in the Crim1KST264/KST264 hypoplastic renal papilla. In contrast, these mice displayed a disorganized papillary vascular network, tissue hypoxia, and elevated Vegfa expression. In addition, we demonstrate the involvement of accompanying systemic hypoxia arising from placental insufficiency, in appropriate papillary maturation. In conclusion, this study highlights the requirement for normal vascular development in collecting duct patterning, development of appropriate nephron architecture, and perinatal papillary maturation, such that disturbances contribute to obstructive nephropathy.

	abstract = {Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is the commonest urological anomaly in children. Despite treatment improvements, associated renal lesions – congenital dysplasia, acquired scarring or both – are a common cause of childhood hypertension and renal failure. Primary VUR is familial, with transmission rate and sibling risk both approaching 50\%, and appears highly genetically heterogeneous. It is often associated with other developmental anomalies of the urinary tract, emphasising its etiology as a disorder of urogenital tract development. We conducted a genome-wide linkage and association study in three European populations to search for loci predisposing to VUR. Family-based association analysis of 1098 parent-affected-child trios and case/control association analysis of 1147 cases and 3789 controls did not reveal any compelling associations, but parametric linkage analysis of 460 families (1062 affected individuals) under a dominant model identified a single region, on 10q26, that showed strong linkage (HLOD = 4.90; ZLRLOD = 4.39) to VUR. The {\textasciitilde}9Mb region contains 69 genes, including some good biological candidates. Resequencing this region in selected individuals did not clearly implicate any gene but FOXI2, FANK1 and GLRX3 remain candidates for further investigation. This, the largest genetic study of VUR to date, highlights the 10q26 region as a major genetic contributor to VUR in European populations.},

	abstract = {Genomewide association studies have identified numerous chronic kidney disease–associated genetic variants, but often do not pinpoint causal genes. This limitation was addressed by combining Mouse Genome Informatics with human genomewide association studies of kidney function. Genes for which mouse models showed abnormal renal physiology, morphology, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), or urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio were identified from Mouse Genome Informatics. The corresponding human orthologs were then evaluated for GFR-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 133,814 individuals and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio-associated SNPs in 54,451 individuals in genome-wide association studies meta-analysis of the CKDGen Consortium. After multiple testing corrections, significant associations with estimated GFR in humans were identified for single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 2, 7, and 17 genes causing abnormal GFR, abnormal physiology, and abnormal morphology in mice, respectively. Genes identified for abnormal kidney morphology showed significant enrichment for estimated GFR–associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms. In total, 19 genes contained variants associated with estimated GFR or the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of which 16 mapped into previously reported genomewide significant loci. CYP26A1 and BMP4 emerged as novel signals subsequently validated in a large, independent study. An additional gene, CYP24A1, was discovered after conditioning on a published nearby association signal. Thus, our novel approach to combine comprehensive mouse phenotype information with human genomewide association studies data resulted in the identification of candidate genes for kidney disease pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {TMEM16A is a transmembrane protein from a conserved family of calcium-activated proteins that is highly expressed in the kidney. TMEM16A confers calcium-activated chloride channel activity, which is of importance for various cellular functions in secretory epithelia and involved in secretion-dependent renal cyst growth. However, its specific function in renal physiology has remained elusive so far. Therefore, we generated conditional nephron-specific TMEM16A-knockout mice and found that these animals suffered from albuminuria. Kidney histology demonstrated an intact corticomedullary differentiation and absence of cysts. Electron microscopy showed a normal slit diaphragm. However, the total number of glomeruli and total nephron count was decreased in TMEM16A-knockout animals. At the same time, glomerular diameter was increased, presumably as a result of the hyperfiltration in the remaining glomeruli. TUNEL and PCNA stainings showed increased cell death and increased proliferation. Proximal tubular cilia were intact in young animals, but the number of properly ciliated cells was decreased in older, albuminuric animals. Taken together, our data suggest that TMEM16A may be involved in ureteric bud branching and proper nephron endowment. Loss of TMEM16A resulted in reduced nephron number and, subsequently, albuminuria and tubular damage.},

	abstract = {The mammalian kidney forms via cell–cell interactions between an epithelial outgrowth of the nephric duct and the surrounding nephrogenic mesenchyme. Initial morphogenetic events include ureteric bud branching to form the collecting duct (CD) tree and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transitions to form the nephrons, requiring reciprocal induction between adjacent mesenchyme and epithelial cells. Within the tips of the branching ureteric epithelium, cells respond to mesenchyme-derived trophic factors by proliferation, migration, and mitosis-associated cell dispersal. Self-inhibition signals from one tip to another play a role in branch patterning. The position, survival, and fate of the nephrogenic mesenchyme are regulated by ECM and secreted signals from adjacent tip and stroma. Signals from the ureteric tip promote mesenchyme self-renewal and trigger nephron formation. Subsequent fusion to the CDs, nephron segmentation and maturation, and formation of a patent glomerular basement membrane also require specialized cell–cell interactions. Differential cadherin, laminin, nectin, and integrin expression, as well as intracellular kinesin and actin-mediated regulation of cell shape and adhesion, underlies these cell–cell interactions. Indeed, the capacity for the kidney to form via self-organization has now been established both via the recapitulation of expected morphogenetic interactions after complete dissociation and reassociation of cellular components during development as well as the in vitro formation of 3D kidney organoids from human pluripotent stem cells. As we understand more about how the many cell–cell interactions required for kidney formation operate, this enables the prospect of bioengineering replacement structures based on these self-organizing properties.},

In this report, we describe an additional patient carrying a de novo missense variant in EBF3 (c.487C{\textgreater}T, p.(Arg163Trp)) that falls within a conserved residue in the zinc knuckle motif of the DNA binding domain. Without a solved structure of the DNA binding domain, we generated a homology-based atomic model and performed molecular dynamics simulations for EBF3, which predicted decreased DNA affinity for p.(Arg163Trp) compared with wild-type protein and control variants. These data are in agreement with previous experimental studies of EBF1 showing the paralogous residue is essential for DNA binding. The conservation and experimental evidence existing for EBF1 and in silico modeling and dynamics simulations to validate comparable behavior of multiple variants in EBF3 demonstrates strong support for the pathogenicity of p.(Arg163Trp). We show that our patient presents with phenotypes consistent with previously reported patients harboring EBF3 variants and expands the phenotypic spectrum of this newly identified disorder with the additional feature of a bicornuate uterus.},

Renal functional units known as nephrons undergo patterning events during development that create a segmental array of cellular compartments with discrete physiological identities. Here, from a forward genetic screen using zebrafish, we report the discovery that transcription factor AP-2 alpha (tfap2a) coordinates a gene regulatory network that activates the terminal differentiation program of distal segments in the pronephros. We found that tfap2a acts downstream of Iroquois homeobox 3b (irx3b), a distal lineage transcription factor, to operate a circuit consisting of tfap2b, irx1a and genes encoding solute transporters that dictate the specialized metabolic functions of distal nephron segments. Interestingly, this regulatory node is distinct from other checkpoints of differentiation, such as polarity establishment and ciliogenesis. Thus, our studies reveal insights into the genetic control of differentiation, where tfap2a is essential for regulating a suite of segment transporter traits at the final tier of zebrafish pronephros ontogeny. These findings have relevance for understanding renal birth defects, as well as efforts to recapitulate nephrogenesis in vivo to facilitate drug discovery and regenerative therapies.},

Therefore, we studied the contribution of Par1a/b to renal epithelial development. We examined the renal phenotype of newborn compound mutant mice carrying only one allele of Par1a or Par1b. Loss of three out of four Par1a/b alleles resulted in severe renal hypoplasia, associated with impaired ureteric bud branching. Compared with kidneys of newborn control littermates, kidneys of newborn mutant mice exhibited dilated proximal tubules and immature glomeruli, and the renal proximal tubular epithelia lacked proper localization of adhesion complexes. Furthermore, Par1a/b mutants expressed low levels of renal Notch ligand Jag1, activated Notch2, and Notch effecter Hes1. Together, these data demonstrate that Par1a/b has a key role in glomerular and proximal tubule development, likely via modulation of Notch signaling.},

	abstract = {Background: During murine kidney development, new cortical blood vessels form and pattern in cycles that coincide with cycles of collecting duct branching and the accompanying splitting of the cap mesenchyme (nephron progenitor cell populations that “cap” collecting duct ends). At no point in the patterning cycle do blood vessels enter the cap mesenchyme. We hypothesized that the exclusion of blood vessels from the cap mesenchyme may be controlled, at least in part, by an anti-angiogenic signal expressed by the cap mesenchyme cells. Results: We show that semaphorin-3f (Sema3f), a known anti-angiogenic factor, is expressed in cap mesenchymal cells and its receptor, neuropilin-2 (Nrp2), is expressed by newly forming blood vessels in the cortex of the developing kidney. We hypothesized that Sema3f/Nrp2 signaling excludes vessels from the cap mesenchyme. Genetic ablation of Sema3f and of Nrp2, however, failed to result in vessels invading the cap mesenchyme. Conclusions: Despite complementary expression patterns, our data suggest that Sema3f and Nrp2 are dispensable for the exclusion of vessels from the cap mesenchyme during kidney development. These results should provoke additional experiments to ascertain the biological significance of Sema3f/Nrp2 expression in the developing kidney.

To construct a spatiotemporal map of NCPC migration pathways into the developing lower urinary tract, we utilized the Sox10-H2BVenus transgene to visualize NCPCs expressing Sox10. Our aim was to define the relationship of Sox10-expressing NCPCs relative to bladder innervation, smooth muscle differentiation, and vascularization through fetal development into adulthood. Sacral NCPC migration is a highly regimented, specifically timed process, with several potential regulatory mileposts. Neuronal differentiation occurs concomitantly with sacral NCPC migration, and neuronal cell bodies are present even before the pelvic ganglia coalesce. Sacral NCPCs reside within the pelvic ganglia anlagen through 13.5 days post coitum (dpc), after which they begin streaming into the bladder body in progressive waves. Smooth muscle differentiation and vascularization of the bladder initiate prior to innervation and appear to be independent processes. In adult bladder, the majority of Sox10+ cells express the glial marker S100β, consistent with Sox10 being a glial marker in other tissues. However, rare Sox10+ NCPCs are seen in close proximity to blood vessels and not all are S100β+, suggesting either glial heterogeneity or a potential nonglial role for Sox10+ cells along vasculature. Taken together, the developmental atlas of Sox10+ NCPC migration and distribution profile of these cells in adult bladder provided here will serve as a roadmap for future investigation in mouse models of lower urinary tract dysfunction.},

Altered DNA methylation plays an important role in the onset and progression of kidney disease. However, little is known about how the changes arise in disease states. Here, we report that KAT5-mediated DNA damage repair is essential for the maintenance of kidney podocytes and is associated with DNA methylation status. Podocyte-specific KAT5-knockout mice develop severe albuminuria with increased DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), increased DNA methylation of the nephrin promoter region, and decreased nephrin expression. Podocyte KAT5 expression is decreased, whereas DNA DSBs and DNA methylation are increased in diabetic nephropathy; moreover, KAT5 restoration by gene transfer attenuates albuminuria. Furthermore, KAT5 decreases DNA DSBs and DNA methylation at the same nephrin promoter region, which indicates that KAT5-mediated DNA repair may be related to DNA methylation status. These results suggest a concept in which an environment of DNA damage repair, which occurs with decreased KAT5, may affect DNA methylation status.},

Bilateral renal agenesis is almost invariably fatal at birth, and unilateral renal agenesis can lead to future health issues including end-stage renal disease. Genetic investigations have identified several gene variants that cause RA, including EYA1, LHX1, and WT1. However, whereas compound null mutations of genes encoding α and γ retinoic acid receptors (RARs) cause RA in mice, to date there have been no reports of variants in RAR genes causing RA in humans. In this study, we carried out whole exome sequence analysis of two families showing inheritance of an RA phenotype, and in both identified a single candidate gene, GREB1L. Analysis of a zebrafish greb1l loss-of-function mutant revealed defects in the pronephric kidney just prior to death, and F0 CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of Greb1l in the mouse revealed kidney agenesis phenotypes, implicating Greb1l in this disorder. GREB1L resides in a chromatin complex with RAR members, and our data implicate GREB1L as a coactivator for RARs. This study is the first to associate a component of the RAR pathway with renal agenesis in humans.},

Using antibody-mediated macrophage-depletion, we show macrophages support vascular anastomoses in cultured kidney explants.

Recent advances in the generation of kidney organoids and the culture of primary nephron progenitors from mouse and human have been based on knowledge of the molecular basis of kidney development in mice. Although gene expression during kidney development has been intensely investigated, single cell profiling provides new opportunities to further subsect component cell types and the signalling networks at play. Here, we describe the generation and analysis of 6732 single cell transcriptomes from the fetal mouse kidney [embryonic day (E)18.5] and 7853 sorted nephron progenitor cells (E14.5). These datasets provide improved resolution of cell types and specific markers, including subdivision of the renal stroma and heterogeneity within the nephron progenitor population. Ligand-receptor interaction and pathway analysis reveals novel crosstalk between cellular compartments and associates new pathways with differentiation of nephron and ureteric epithelium cell types. We identify transcriptional congruence between the distal nephron and ureteric epithelium, showing that most markers previously used to identify ureteric epithelium are not specific. Together, this work improves our understanding of metanephric kidney development and provides a template to guide the regeneration of renal tissue.},

Inactivation of TRIM28, either germline or somatic, occurred through inactivating mutations, loss of heterozygosity or epigenetic silencing. TRIM28-mutated tumours had a monomorphic epithelial histology that is uncommon for Wilms tumour. Critically, these tumours were negative for TRIM28 immunohistochemical staining whereas the epithelial component in normal tissue and other Wilms tumours stained positively.

Zebrafish kidneys use resident kidney stem cells to replace damaged tubules with new nephrons: the filtration units of the kidney. What stimulates kidney progenitor cells to form new nephrons is not known. Here, we show that wnt9a and wnt9b are induced in the injured kidney at sites where frizzled9b- and lef1-expressing progenitor cells form new nephrons. New nephron aggregates are patterned by Wnt signaling, with high canonical Wnt-signaling cells forming a single cell thick rosette that demarcates: domains of cell proliferation in the elongating nephron; and tubule fusion where the new nephron plumbs into the distal tubule and establishes blood filtrate drainage. Pharmacological blockade of canonical Wnt signaling inhibited new nephron formation after injury by inhibiting cell proliferation, and resulted in loss of polarized rosette structures in the aggregates. Mutation in frizzled9b reduced total kidney nephron number, caused defects in tubule morphology and reduced regeneration of new nephrons after injury. Our results demonstrate an essential role for Wnt/frizzled signaling in adult zebrafish kidney development and regeneration, highlighting conserved mechanisms underlying both mammalian kidney development and kidney stem cell-directed neonephrogenesis in zebrafish.},

The tumor suppressor BRCA2 is essential for homologous recombination (HR), replication fork stability, and DNA interstrand crosslink repair in vertebrates. We identify HSF2BP, a protein previously described as testis specific and not characterized functionally, as an interactor of BRCA2 in mouse embryonic stem cells, where the 2 proteins form a constitutive complex. HSF2BP is transcribed in all cultured human cancer cell lines tested and elevated in some tumor samples. Inactivation of the mouse Hsf2bp gene results in male infertility due to a severe HR defect during spermatogenesis. The BRCA2-HSF2BP interaction is highly evolutionarily conserved and maps to armadillo repeats in HSF2BP and a 68-amino acid region between the BRC repeats and the DNA binding domain of human BRCA2 (Gly2270-Thr2337) encoded by exons 12 and 13. This region of BRCA2 does not harbor known cancer-associated missense mutations and may be involved in the reproductive rather than the tumor-suppressing function of BRCA2.},

In adult kidneys, these cells are organized in rosettes suggesting functional interactions. Genetic studies in mouse revealed that transcription factor Tfcp2l1 coordinates IC and PC development. Tfcp2l1 induces the expression of IC specific genes, including specific H+-ATPase subunits and Jag1. Jag1 in turn, initiates Notch signaling in PCs but inhibits Notch signaling in ICs. Tfcp2l1 inactivation deletes ICs, whereas Jag1 inactivation results in the forfeiture of discrete IC and PC identities. Thus, Tfcp2l1 is a critical regulator of IC-PC patterning, acting cell-autonomously in ICs, and non-cell-autonomously in PCs. As a result, Tfcp2l1 regulates the diversification of cell types which is the central characteristic of 'salt and pepper' epithelia and distinguishes the collecting duct from all other nephron segments.},

It is well established that transforming growth factor-β family member anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) secreted from the fetal testis and its type 1 and 2 receptors expressed in MD mesenchyme regulate MD regression. However, little is known about the molecular network regulating downstream actions of AMH signaling. To identify potential AMH-induced genes and regulatory networks controlling MD regression in a global nonbiased manner, we examined transcriptome differences in MD mesenchyme between males (AMH signaling on) and females (AMH signaling off) by RNA-seq analysis of purified fetal MD mesenchymal cells. This analysis found 82 genes up-regulated in males during MD regression and identified Osterix (Osx)/Sp7, a key transcriptional regulator of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, as a downstream effector of AMH signaling during MD regression. Osx/OSX was expressed in a male-specific pattern in MD mesenchyme during MD regression. OSX expression was lost in mutant males without AMH signaling. In addition, transgenic mice ectopically expressing human AMH in females induced a male pattern of Osx expression. Together, these results indicate that AMH signaling is necessary and sufficient for Osx expression in the MD mesenchyme. In addition, MD regression was delayed in Osx-null males, identifying Osx as a factor that regulates MD regression.},

We show that a functionally uncharacterized protein, HSF2BP, is involved in a novel, direct and highly evolutionarily conserved interaction with BRCA2. Although \textit{HSF2BP} was previously described as testis-specific, we find it is expressed in mouse ES cells, in human cancer cell lines, and in tumor samples. Elevated levels of HSF2BP sensitize human cells to ICL-inducing agents (mitomycin C and cisplatin) and PARP inhibitors, resulting in a phenotype characteristic of cells from Fanconi anemia (FA) patients. We biochemically recapitulate the suppression of ICL repair and establish that excess HSF2BP specifically compromises homologous recombination by preventing BRCA2 and RAD51 loading at the ICL. As increased ectopic expression of HSF2BP occurs naturally, we suggest that it can be considered as a causative agent in FA and a source of cancer-promoting genomic instability.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

During nephrogenesis, stem/progenitor cells differentiate and give rise to early nephron structures that segment to proximal and distal nephron cell types. Previously, we prospectively isolated progenitors from human fetal kidney (hFK) utilizing a combination of surface markers. However, upon culture nephron progenitors differentiated and could not be robustly maintained in vitro. Here, by culturing hFK in a modified medium used for in vitro growth of mouse nephron progenitors, and by dissection of NCAM+/CD133− progenitor cells according to EpCAM expression (NCAM+/CD133−/EpCAM−, NCAM+/CD133−/EpCAMdim, NCAM+/CD133−/EpCAMbright), we show at single-cell resolution a preservation of uninduced and induced cap mesenchyme as well as a transitioning mesenchymal-epithelial state. Concomitantly, differentiating and differentiated epithelial lineages are also maintained. In vitro expansion of discrete stages of early human nephrogenesis in nephron stem cell cultures may be used for drug screening on a full repertoire of developing kidney cells and for prospective isolation of mesenchymal or epithelial renal lineages for regenerative medicine.},

When M15 cells were transfected with a β-catenin luciferase reporter plasmid, exposure to recombinant WNT9b resulted in minimal luciferase activity. We then analyzed mRNA-expression of WNT-pathway components and identified Fzd1-6 and Lrp6 transcripts but not Rspo1. When M15 cells were treated with recombinant RSPO1 the response to transfected WNT9b was augmented 4.8-fold. Co-transfection of M15 cells with Fzd5 (but no other Fzd family member) further increased the WNT9b signal to 16.8-fold and siRNA knockdown of Fzd5 reduced the signal by 52\%. Knockdown of Lrp6 resulted in 60\% WNT9b signal reduction. We confirmed Fzd5, Lrp6 and Rspo1 mRNA expression in CITED1(+) NPCs from E15.5 embryonic mouse kidney. Thus, while many WNT signaling-pathway components are present by E10.5, optimum responsiveness of E11.5 cap mesenchyme requires that NPCs acquire RSPO1, FZD5 and LRP6.},

The mammalian kidney develops through reciprocal interactions between the ureteric bud and the metanephric mesenchyme to give rise to the entire collecting system and the nephrons. Most of our knowledge of the developmental regulators driving this process arises from the study of gene expression and functional genetics in mice and other animal models. In order to shed light on human kidney development, we have used single-cell transcriptomics to characterize gene expression in different cell populations, and to study individual cell dynamics and lineage trajectories during development. Single-cell transcriptome analyses of 6414 cells from five individual specimens identified 11 initial clusters of specific renal cell types as defined by their gene expression profile. Further subclustering identifies progenitors, and mature and intermediate stages of differentiation for several renal lineages. Other lineages identified include mesangium, stroma, endothelial and immune cells. Novel markers for these cell types were revealed in the analysis, as were components of key signaling pathways driving renal development in animal models. Altogether, we provide a comprehensive and dynamic gene expression profile of the developing human kidney at the single-cell level.},

            Stem cell‐derived kidney organoids contain nephron segments that recapitulate morphological and functional aspects of the human kidney. However, directed differentiation protocols for kidney organoids are largely conducted using biochemical signals to control differentiation. Here, the hypothesis that mechanical signals regulate nephrogenesis is investigated in 3D culture by encapsulating kidney organoids within viscoelastic alginate hydrogels with varying rates of stress relaxation. Tubular nephron segments are significantly more convoluted in kidney organoids differentiated in encapsulating hydrogels when compared with those in suspension culture. Hydrogel viscoelasticity regulates the spatial distribution of nephron segments within the differentiating kidney organoids. Consistent with these observations, a particle‐based computational model predicts that the extent of deformation of the hydrogel–organoid interface regulates the morphology of nephron segments. Elevated extracellular calcium levels in the culture medium, which can be impacted by the hydrogels, decrease the glomerulus‐to‐tubule ratio of nephron segments. These findings reveal that hydrogel encapsulation regulates nephron patterning and morphology and suggest that the mechanical microenvironment is an important design variable for kidney regenerative medicine.},

            The kidney vasculature has a complex architecture that is essential for renal function. The molecular mechanisms that direct development of kidney blood vessels are poorly characterized. We identified a regionally restricted, stroma-derived signaling molecule, netrin 1 (Ntn1), as a regulator of renal vascular patterning in mice. Stromal progenitor (SP)-specific ablation of Ntn1 (Ntn1SPKO) resulted in smaller kidneys with fewer glomeruli, as well as profound defects of the renal artery and transient blood flow disruption. Notably, Ntn1 ablation resulted in loss of arterial vascular smooth muscle cell (vSMC) coverage and in ectopic SMC deposition at the kidney surface. This was accompanied by dramatic reduction of arterial tree branching that perdured postnatally. Transcriptomic analysis of Ntn1SPKO kidneys revealed dysregulation of vSMC differentiation, including downregulation of Klf4, which we find expressed in a subset of SPs. Stromal Klf4 deletion similarly resulted in decreased smooth muscle coverage and arterial branching without, however, the disruption of renal artery patterning and perfusion seen in Ntn1SPKO. These data suggest a stromal Ntn1-Klf4 axis that regulates stromal differentiation and reinforces stromal-derived smooth muscle as a key regulator of renal blood vessel formation.},

            Kidney organoids are three-dimensional structures generated from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) that are capable of recapitulating the major structures of mammalian kidneys. As this technology is expected to be a promising tool for studying renal biology, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine, the functional capacity of kidney organoids has emerged as a critical question in the field. Kidney organoids produced using several protocols harbor key structures of native kidneys. Here, we review the current state, recent advances, and future challenges in the functional characterization of kidney organoids, strategies to accelerate and enhance kidney organoid functions, and access to PSC resources to advance organoid research. The strategies to construct physiologically relevant kidney organoids include the use of organ-on-a-chip technologies that integrate fluid circulation and improve organoid maturation. These approaches result in increased expression of the major tubular transporters and elements of mechanosensory signaling pathways suggestive of improved functionality. Nevertheless, continuous efforts remain crucial to create kidney tissue that more faithfully replicates physiological conditions for future applications in kidney regeneration medicine and their ethical use in patient care.

	abstract = {Directed differentiation of stem cells is an attractive approach to generate kidney tissue for regenerative therapies. Currently, the most informative platform to test the regenerative potential of this tissue is engraftment into kidneys of immunocompromised rodents. Stem cell-derived kidney tissue is vascularized following engraftment, but the connection between epithelial tubules that is critical for urine to pass from the graft to the host collecting system has not yet been demonstrated. We show that one significant obstacle to tubule fusion is the accumulation of fibrillar collagens at the interface between the graft and the host. As a screening strategy to identify factors that can prevent this collagen accumulation, we propose encapsulating laboratory-grown kidney tissue in fibrin hydrogels supplemented with candidate compounds such as recombinant proteins, small molecules, feeder cells, and gene therapy vectors to condition the local graft environment. We demonstrate that the AAV-DJ serotype is an efficient gene therapy vector for the subcapsular region and that it is specific for interstitial cells in this compartment. In addition to the histological evaluation of epithelial tubule fusion, we demonstrate the specificity of two urine biomarker assays that can be used to detect human-specific markers of the proximal nephron (CD59) and the distal nephron (uromodulin), and we demonstrate the deposition of human graft-derived urine into the mouse collecting system. Using the testing platform described in this report, it will be possible to systematically screen factors for their potential to promote epithelial fusion of graft and host tissue with a functional intravital read-out.},

ment have failed to keep pace with the needs of increasingly data-intensive science. The overhead and burden of managing data in complex discovery processes, involving experimental protocols with numerous data-producing and computational steps, has become the gating factor that determines the pace of discovery. The lack of comprehensive systems to capture, manage, organize and retrieve data throughout the discovery life cycle leads to significant overheads on scientists time and effort, reduced productivity, lack of reproducibility, and an absence of data sharing.
In “creative fields” like digital photography and music, digi- tal asset management (DAM) systems for capturing, managing, curating and consuming digital assets like photos and audio recordings, have fundamentally transformed how these data are used. While asset management has not taken hold in eScience applications, we believe that transformation similar to that observed in the creative space could be achieved in scientific domains if appropriate ecosystems of asset management tools existed, tools to capture, manage, and curate data throughout the scientific discovery process. We introduce a framework and infrastructure for asset management in eScience and present initial results from its usage in active research use cases.},

	abstract = {Scientific discovery is increasingly dependent on a scientist's ability to acquire, curate, integrate, analyze, and share large and diverse collections of data. While the details vary from domain to domain, these data often consist of diverse digital assets (e.g. image files, sequence data, or simulation outputs) that are organized with complex relationships and context which may evolve over the course of an investigation. In addition, discovery is often collaborative, such that sharing of the data and its organizational context is highly desirable. Common systems for managing file or asset metadata hide their inherent relational structures, while traditional relational database systems do not extend to the distributed collaborative environment often seen in scientific investigations. To address these issues, we introduce ERMrest, a collaborative data management service which allows general entity-relationship modeling of metadata manipulated by RESTful access methods. We present the design criteria, architecture, and service implementation, as well as describe an ecosystem of tools and services that we have created to integrate metadata into an end-to-end scientific data life cycle. ERMrest has been deployed to hundreds of users across multiple scientific research communities and projects. We present two representative use cases: an international consortium and an early-phase, multidisciplinary research project.},

            Stem cells are enabling an improved understanding of the peripheral arterial disease, and patient-specific stem cell-derived endothelial cells (ECs) present major advantages as a therapeutic modality. However, applications of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived ECs are limited by rapid loss of mature cellular function in culture. We hypothesized that changes in autophagy impact the phenotype and cellular proliferation of iPSC-ECs. Endothelial cells were differentiated from distinct induced pluripotent stem cell lines in 2D culture and purified for CD144 positive cells. Autophagy, mitochondrial morphology, and proliferation were characterized during differentiation and over serial passages in culture. We found that autophagy activity was stimulated during differentiation but stagnated in mature iPSC-ECs. Mitochondria remodeled through mitophagy during differentiation and demonstrated increasing membrane potential and mass through serial passages; however, these plateaued, coinciding with decreased proliferation. To evaluate for oxidative damage, iPSC-ECs were alternatively grown under hypoxic culture conditions; however, hypoxia only transiently improved the proliferation. Stimulating mTOR-independent ULK1-mediated autophagy with a plant derivative AMP kinase activator Rg2 significantly improved proliferative capacity of iPSC-ECs over multiple passages. Therefore, autophagy, a known mediator of longevity, played an active role in remodeling mitochondria during maturation from pluripotency to a terminally differentiated state. Autophagy failed to compensate for increasing mitochondrial mass over serial passages, which correlated with loss of proliferation in iPSC-ECs. Stimulating ULK1-kinase-driven autophagy conferred improved proliferation and longevity over multiple passages in culture. This represents a novel approach to overcoming a major barrier limiting the use of iPSC-ECs for clinical and research applications.},

	abstract = {Kidney organoids derived from hPSCs have opened new opportunities to develop kidney models for preclinical studies and immunocompatible kidney tissues for regeneration. Organoids resemble native nephrons that consist of filtration units and tubules, yet little is known about the functional capacity of these organoid structures. Transcriptomic analyses provide insight into maturation and transporter activities that represent kidney functions. However, functional assays in organoids are necessary to demonstrate the activity of these transport proteins in live tissues. The three-dimensional (3D) architecture adds complexity to real-time assays in kidney organoids. Here, we develop a functional assay using live imaging to assess transepithelial transport of rhodamine 123 (Rh123), a fluorescent substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), in organoids affixed to coverslip culture plates for accurate real-time observation. The identity of organoid structures was probed using Lotus Tetragonolobus Lectin (LTL), which binds to glycoproteins present on the surface of proximal tubules. Within 20 min of the addition of Rh123 to culture media, Rh123 accumulated in the tubular lumen of organoids. Basolateral-to-apical accumulation of the dye/marker was reduced by pharmacologic inhibition of MDR1 or OCT2, and OCT2 inhibition reduced the Rh123 uptake. The magnitude of Rh123 transport was maturation-dependent, consistent with MDR1 expression levels assessed by RNA-seq and immunohistochemistry. Specifically, organoids on day 21 exhibit less accumulation of Rh123 in the lumen unlike later-stage organoids from day 30 of differentiation. Our work establishes a live functional assessment in 3D kidney organoids, enabling the functional phenotyping of organoids in health and disease.},

In service of these goals, data ought to be FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The FaceBase data repository and educational resources exemplify the FAIR principles and support a broad user community including researchers in craniofacial development, molecular genetics, and genomics. FaceBase demonstrates that a model in which researchers “self-curate” their data can be successful and scalable. We present the results of the first 2.5 y of FaceBase’s operations as an open community and summarize the data sets published during this period. We then describe a research highlight from work on the identification of regulatory networks and noncoding RNAs involved in cleft lip with/without cleft palate that both used and in turn contributed new findings to publicly available FaceBase resources. Collectively, FaceBase serves as a dynamic and continuously evolving resource to facilitate data-intensive research, enhance data reproducibility, and perform deep phenotyping across multiple species in dental and craniofacial research.},

	abstract = {Zebrafish are an established research organism that has made many contributions to our understanding of vertebrate tissue and organ development, yet there are still significant gaps in our understanding of the genes that regulate gonad development, sex, and reproduction. Unlike the development of many organs, such as the brain and heart that form during the first few days of development, zebrafish gonads do not begin to form until the larval stage (≥5 days post-fertilization). Thus, forward genetic screens have identified very few genes required for gonad development. In addition, bulk RNA-sequencing studies that identify genes expressed in the gonads do not have the resolution necessary to define minor cell populations that may play significant roles in the development and function of these organs. To overcome these limitations, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptomes of cells isolated from juvenile zebrafish ovaries. This resulted in the profiles of 10,658 germ cells and 14,431 somatic cells. Our germ cell data represents all developmental stages from germline stem cells to early meiotic oocytes. Our somatic cell data represents all known somatic cell types, including follicle cells, theca cells, and ovarian stromal cells. Further analysis revealed an unexpected number of cell subpopulations within these broadly defined cell types. To further define their functional significance, we determined the location of these cell subpopulations within the ovary. Finally, we used gene knockout experiments to determine the roles of
              foxl2l
              and

Here we review assays of physiological function in human kidney organoids, best practices for quality control, and future applications. Tubular structures in organoids accumulate specific molecules through active transport, including dextran and organic anions, and swell with fluid in response to cyclic adenosine monophosphate stimulation. When engrafted into animal models in vivo, organoids form vascularized glomerulus-like structures capable of size-selective filtration. Organoids exhibit metabolic, endocrine, injury, and infection phenotypes, although their specificity is not yet fully clear. To properly interpret organoid physiology assays, it is important to incorporate appropriate negative and positive controls, statistical methods, data presentation, molecular mechanisms, and clinical datasets. Improvements in organoid perfusion, patterning, and maturation are needed to enable branching morphogenesis, urine production, and renal replacement. Reconstituting renal physiology with kidney organoids is a new field with potential to provide fresh insights into classical phenomena.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            Expansion of interstitial cells in the adult kidney is a hallmark of chronic disease, whereas their proliferation during fetal development is necessary for organ formation. An intriguing difference between adult and neonatal kidneys is that the neonatal kidney has the capacity to control interstitial cell proliferation when the target number has been reached. In this study, we define the consequences of inactivating the TGFβ/Smad response in the mouse interstitial cell lineage. We find that pathway inactivation through loss of Smad4 leads to overproliferation of interstitial cells regionally in the kidney medulla. Analysis of markers for BMP and TGFβ pathway activation reveals that loss of Smad4 primarily reduces TGFβ signaling in the interstitium. Whereas TGFβ signaling is reduced in these cells, marker analysis shows that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is increased. Our analysis supports a model in which Wnt/β-catenin-mediated proliferation is attenuated by TGFβ/Smad to ensure that proliferation ceases when the target number of interstitial cells has been reached in the neonatal medulla.},

	abstract = {Kidneys have the capacity for intrinsic repair, preserving kidney architecture with return to a basal state after tubular injury. When injury is overwhelming or repetitive, however, that capacity is exceeded and incomplete repair results in fibrotic tissue replacing normal kidney parenchyma. Loss of nephrons correlates with reduced kidney function, which defines chronic kidney disease (CKD) and confers substantial morbidity and mortality to the worldwide population. Despite the identification of pathways involved in intrinsic repair, limited treatments for CKD exist, partly because of the limited throughput and predictivity of animal studies. Here, we showed that kidney organoids can model the transition from intrinsic to incomplete repair. Single-nuclear RNA sequencing of kidney organoids after cisplatin exposure identified 159 differentially expressed genes and 29 signal pathways in tubular cells undergoing intrinsic repair. Homology-directed repair (HDR) genes including Fanconi anemia complementation group D2 (
              FANCD2
              ) and RAD51 recombinase (
              RAD51
              ) were transiently up-regulated during intrinsic repair but were down-regulated in incomplete repair. Single cellular transcriptomics in mouse models of obstructive and hemodynamic kidney injury and human kidney samples of immune-mediated injury validated HDR gene up-regulation during tubular repair. Kidney biopsy samples with tubular injury and varying degrees of fibrosis confirmed loss of FANCD2 during incomplete repair. Last, we performed targeted drug screening that identified the DNA ligase IV inhibitor, SCR7, as a therapeutic candidate that rescued FANCD2/RAD51-mediated repair to prevent the progression of CKD in the cisplatin-induced organoid injury model. Our findings demonstrate the translational utility of kidney organoids to identify pathologic pathways and potential therapies.

            Fingering FANCD2 in tubular repair
            
              The transition from acute kidney injury, characterized by intrinsic repair, to incomplete repair and chronic damage has been difficult to study. Here, Gupta and colleagues modeled the transition from intrinsic to incomplete repair using human kidney organoids. A single exposure to cisplatin resulted in intrinsic repair, with preserved tubular architecture and up-regulation of genes associated with homology-directed repair, including Fanconi anemia complementation group D2 (
              FANCD2
              ). However, with repeated cisplatin exposure,
              FANCD2
              and RAD51 recombinase (
              RAD51
              ) were down-regulated, leading to incomplete repair. The DNA ligase IV inhibitor SCR7 increased FANCD2-mediated repair and ameliorated progression to chronic injury in the organoids, suggesting that targeting the FANCD2/RAD51 pathway may have potential to treat kidney disease.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Hemolysis occurs in many injury settings and can trigger disease processes. In the kidney, extracellular hemoglobin can induce damage via several mechanisms. These include oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation, which promote fibrosis and chronic kidney disease. Understanding the pathophysiology of these injury pathways offers opportunities to develop new therapeutic strategies.
            
            
              Methods
              To model hemolysis-induced kidney injury, human kidney organoids were treated with hemin, an iron-containing porphyrin, that generates reactive oxygen species. In addition, we developed an induced pluripotent stem cell line expressing the biosensor, CytochromeC-GFP (CytoC-GFP), which provides a real-time readout of mitochondrial morphology, health, and early apoptotic events.
            
            
              Results
              We found that hemin-treated kidney organoids show oxidative damage, increased expression of injury markers, impaired functionality of organic anion and cation transport and undergo fibrosis. Injury could be detected in live CytoC-GFP organoids by cytoplasmic localization of fluorescence. Finally, we show that 4-(phenylthio)butanoic acid, an HDAC inhibitor with anti-fibrotic effects in vivo, reduces hemin-induced human kidney organoid fibrosis.
            
            
              Conclusion
              This work establishes a hemin-induced model of kidney organoid injury. This platform provides a new tool to study the injury and repair response pathways in human kidney tissue and will assist in the development of new therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Discovery of new knowledge is increasingly data-driven, predicated on a team's ability to collaboratively create, find, analyze, retrieve, and share pertinent datasets over the duration of an investigation. This is especially true in the domain of scientific discovery where generation, analysis, and interpretation of data are the fundamental mechanisms by which research teams collaborate to achieve their shared scientific goal. Data-driven discovery in general, and scientific discovery in particular, is distinguished by complex and diverse data models and formats that evolve over the lifetime of an investigation. While databases and related information systems have the potential to be valuable tools in the discovery process, developing effective interfaces for data-driven discovery remains a roadblock to the application of database technology as an essential tool in scientific investigations. In this paper, we present a model-adaptive approach to creating interaction environments for data-driven discovery of scientific data that automatically generates interactive user interfaces for editing, searching, and viewing scientific data based entirely on introspection of an extended relational data model. We have applied model-adaptive interface generation to many active scientific investigations spanning domains of proteomics, bioinformatics, neuroscience, occupational therapy, stem cells, genitourinary, craniofacial development, and others. We present the approach, its implementation, and its evaluation through analysis of its usage in diverse scientific settings.},

Such needs arise when downloading data from a repository, moving data between remote locations, exchanging data between collaborators, and even publishing data as part of the publication process. While such examples are common, it is surprisingly difficult to describe and exchange data, and it is even more difficult when datasets are large and span multiple storage locations. To address some of these challenges we proposed the Big Data Bag (BDBag) as a data packaging format for representing and describing complex, distributed, and large datasets. In this presentation, we outline the BDBag model and describe three scenarios in which it is currently being used},

	abstract = {Comprehensive modeling of a whole cell requires an integration of vast amounts of information on various aspects of the cell and its parts. To divide and conquer this task, we introduce Bayesian metamodeling, a general approach to modeling complex systems by integrating a collection of heterogeneous input models. Each input model can in principle be based on any type of data and can describe a different aspect of the modeled system using any mathematical representation, scale, and level of granularity. These input models are 1) converted to a standardized statistical representation relying on probabilistic graphical models, 2) coupled by modeling their mutual relations with the physical world, and 3) finally harmonized with respect to each other. To illustrate Bayesian metamodeling, we provide a proof-of-principle metamodel of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by human pancreatic β-cells. The input models include a coarse-grained spatiotemporal simulation of insulin vesicle trafficking, docking, and exocytosis; a molecular network model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion signaling; a network model of insulin metabolism; a structural model of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor activation; a linear model of a pancreatic cell population; and ordinary differential equations for systemic postprandial insulin response. Metamodeling benefits from decentralized computing, while often producing a more accurate, precise, and complete model that contextualizes input models as well as resolves conflicting information. We anticipate Bayesian metamodeling will facilitate collaborative science by providing a framework for sharing expertise, resources, data, and models, as exemplified by the Pancreatic β-Cell Consortium.},

            The FaceBase Consortium was established by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research in 2009 as a ‘big data’ resource for the craniofacial research community. Over the past decade, researchers have deposited hundreds of annotated and curated datasets on both normal and disordered craniofacial development in FaceBase, all freely available to the research community on the FaceBase Hub website. The Hub has developed numerous visualization and analysis tools designed to promote integration of multidisciplinary data while remaining dedicated to the FAIR principles of data management (findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability) and providing a faceted search infrastructure for locating desired data efficiently. Summaries of the datasets generated by the FaceBase projects from 2014 to 2019 are provided here. FaceBase 3 now welcomes contributions of data on craniofacial and dental development in humans, model organisms and cell lines. Collectively, the FaceBase Consortium, along with other NIH-supported data resources, provide a continuously growing, dynamic and current resource for the scientific community while improving data reproducibility and fulfilling data sharing requirements.},

          The Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) has created a flexible system of data federation that enables users to discover datasets from across the Common Fund without requiring the data owners to move, reformat, or rehost those data. The CFDEs federation system is centered on a catalog that ingests metadata from individual Common Fund Program’s Data Coordination Centers (DCCs) into a uniform metadata model that can then be indexed and searched from a centralized portal. This uniform Crosscut Metadata Model (C2M2), supports the wide variety of data types and metadata terms used by the individual DCCs and is designed to enable easy expansion to accommodate new data types.},

              390, 604–607 (1997)], the underlying structural changes at the synapse level remain poorly understood. Here, we capture synaptic changes in the midlarval zebrafish brain that occur during associative memory formation by imaging excitatory synapses labeled with recombinant probes using selective plane illumination microscopy. Imaging the same subjects before and after classical conditioning at single-synapse resolution provides an unbiased mapping of synaptic changes accompanying memory formation. In control animals and animals that failed to learn the task, there were no significant changes in the spatial patterns of synapses in the pallium, which contains the equivalent of the mammalian amygdala and is essential for associative learning in teleost fish [M. Portavella, J. P. Vargas, B. Torres, C. Salas,
              Brain Res. Bull
              . 57, 397–399 (2002)]. In zebrafish that formed memories, we saw a dramatic increase in the number of synapses in the ventrolateral pallium, which contains neurons active during memory formation and retrieval. Concurrently, synapse loss predominated in the dorsomedial pallium. Surprisingly, we did not observe significant changes in the intensity of synaptic labeling, a proxy for synaptic strength, with memory formation in any region of the pallium. Our results suggest that memory formation due to classical conditioning is associated with reciprocal changes in synapse numbers in the pallium.},

Here, we combine SARS-CoV-2 variants with  genome-edited kidney organoids and clinical data to investigate tropism, mechanism,  and therapeutics. SARS-CoV-2 specifically infects organoid proximal tubules among  diverse cell types. Infections produce replicating virus, apoptosis, and disrupted  cell morphology, features of which are revealed in the context of polycystic kidney  disease. Cross-validation of gene expression patterns in organoids reflects  proteomic signatures of COVID-19 in the urine of critically ill patients indicating  interferon pathway upregulation.

	abstract = {Podocytes are critical to maintaining the kidney glomerular filtration barrier. Mutations in genes associated with development of nephrotic syndrome lead to elevated cytoplasmic calcium in podocytes and cause disruption of filtration barrier function. Whether calcium signaling plays a role in the initial formation of the filtration barrier is not known. Using live calcium imaging in two models, larval zebrafish and human kidney organoids, the authors demonstrate that podocyte calcium signaling is active during podocyte differentiation, is podocyte-cell autonomous, occurs independently of neighboring cell types, and is required for foot process and slit diaphragm formation. Their findings also show that developmental calcium signaling occurs by a different mechanism than disease-associated calcium perturbations, and represents a critical regulatory signal for podocyte morphogenesis and filtration barrier formation.Background Podocytes are critical to maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier, and mutations in nephrotic syndrome genes are known to affect podocyte calcium signaling. However, the role of calcium signaling during podocyte development remains unknown.Methods We undertook live imaging of calcium signaling in developing podocytes, using zebrafish larvae and human kidney organoids. To evaluate calcium signaling during development and in response to channel blockers and genetic defects, the calcium biosensor GCaMP6s was expressed in zebrafish podocytes. We used electron microscopy to evaluate filtration barrier formation in zebrafish, and Fluo-4 to detect calcium signals in differentiating podocytes in human kidney organoids.Results Immature zebrafish podocytes (2.5 days postfertilization) generated calcium transients that correlated with interactions with forming glomerular capillaries. Calcium transients persisted until 4 days postfertilization, and were absent after glomerular barrier formation was complete. We detected similar calcium transients in maturing human organoid glomeruli, suggesting a conserved mechanism. In both models, inhibitors of SERCA or IP3 receptor calcium-release channels blocked calcium transients in podocytes, whereas lanthanum was ineffective, indicating the calcium source is from intracellular podocyte endoplasmic-reticulum stores. Calcium transients were not affected by blocking heartbeat or by blocking development of endothelium or endoderm, and they persisted in isolated glomeruli, suggesting podocyte-autonomous calcium release. Inhibition of expression of phospholipase C-γ1, but not nephrin or phospholipase C-ε1, led to significantly decreased calcium activity. Finally, blocking calcium release affected glomerular shape and podocyte foot process formation, supporting the critical role of calcium signaling in glomerular morphogenesis.Conclusions These findings establish podocyte cell–autonomous calcium signaling as a prominent and evolutionarily conserved feature of podocyte differentiation and demonstrate its requirement for podocyte foot process formation.},

There is a long-held  belief that interactions between progenitors of the collecting ducts and nephrons  are primarily responsible for kidney development. However, over the last several  years, it has become increasingly clear that multiple aspects of kidney development  require signaling from the interstitium. How the interstitium orchestrates these  various roles is poorly understood. Here, we show that during development the  interstitium is a highly heterogeneous patterned population of cells that occupies  distinct positions correlated to the adjacent parenchyma. Our analysis indicates  that the heterogeneity is not a mere reflection of different stages in a linear  developmental trajectory but instead represents several novel differentiated cell  states. Further, we find that β-catenin has a cell autonomous role in the  development of a medullary subset of the interstitium and that this non-autonomously  affects the development of the adjacent epithelia. These findings suggest the  intriguing possibility that the different interstitial subtypes may create  microenvironments that play unique roles in development of the adjacent epithelia  and endothelia.},

A stark shortage of organs has fueled interest in generating viable  replacement tissues ex vivo for transplantation. One promising approach has been  self-organizing organoids, which mimic developmental processes and yield  multicellular, organ-specific tissues. However, a recognized roadblock to this  approach is that many organoid cell types fail to acquire full maturity and  function. Here, we comprehensively assess the vasculature in two distinct kidney  organoid models as well as in explanted embryonic kidneys. Using a variety of  methods, we show that while organoids can develop a wide range of kidney cell types,  as previously shown, endothelial cells (ECs) initially arise but then rapidly  regress over time in culture. Vasculature of cultured embryonic kidneys exhibit  similar regression. By contrast, engraftment of kidney organoids under the kidney  capsule results in the formation of a stable, perfused vasculature that integrates  into the organoid. This work demonstrates that kidney organoids offer a promising  model system to define the complexities of vascular-nephron interactions, but the  establishment and maintenance of a vascular network present unique challenges when  grown ex vivo.},

Kidney organoids resemble the human kidney in vitro and can be applied in regenerative medicine and as developmental, toxicity, and disease models. Although current studies have shown great promise, challenges remain including the immaturity, limited reproducibility, and lack of perfusable vascular and collecting duct systems. This review gives an overview of our current understanding of nephrogenesis that enabled the generation of kidney organoids. Next, the potential applications of kidney organoids are discussed followed by future perspectives.

	abstract = {A single acute kidney injury event increases the risk of progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Combining single-nucleus RNA sequencing with genetic tracing of injured proximal tubule cells identified a spatially dynamic, evolving injury response following ischemia–reperfusion injury. Failed proximal tubule repair leads to the persistence of a profibrotic, proinflammatory Vcam1+/Ccl2+ cell type exhibiting a senescence-associated secretory phenotype and a marked transcriptional activation of NF-κB and AP-1 pathway signatures, but no signs of G2/M cell cycle arrest. Insights from this study can inform strategies to improve renal repair and prevent CKD progression.Acute kidney injury (AKI), commonly caused by ischemia, sepsis, or nephrotoxic insult, is associated with increased mortality and a heightened risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). AKI results in the dysfunction or death of proximal tubule cells (PTCs), triggering a poorly understood autologous cellular repair program. Defective repair associates with a long-term transition to CKD. We performed a mild-to-moderate ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI) to model injury responses reflective of kidney injury in a variety of clinical settings, including kidney transplant surgery. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of genetically labeled injured PTCs at 7-d (“early”) and 28-d (“late”) time points post-IRI identified specific gene and pathway activity in the injury–repair transition. In particular, we identified Vcam1+/Ccl2+ PTCs at a late injury stage distinguished by marked activation of NF-κB–, TNF-, and AP-1–signaling pathways. This population of PTCs showed features of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype but did not exhibit G2/M cell cycle arrest, distinct from other reports of maladaptive PTCs following kidney injury. Fate-mapping experiments identified spatially and temporally distinct origins for these cells. At the cortico-medullary boundary (CMB), where injury initiates, the majority of Vcam1+/Ccl2+ PTCs arose from early replicating PTCs. In contrast, in cortical regions, only a subset of Vcam1+/Ccl2+ PTCs could be traced to early repairing cells, suggesting late-arising sites of secondary PTC injury. Together, these data indicate even moderate IRI is associated with a lasting injury, which spreads from the CMB to cortical regions. Remaining failed-repair PTCs are likely triggers for chronic disease progression.The single-nuclei RNA sequencing data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession no.

Data are now available for millions of cells, for whole-genome measurements and for multiple modalities. Although analyses of such multimodal datasets have the potential to provide new insights into biological processes that cannot be inferred with a single mode of assay, the integration of very large, complex, multimodal data into biological models and mechanisms represents a considerable challenge. An understanding of the principles of data integration and visualization methods is required to determine what methods are best applied to a particular single-cell dataset. Each class of method has advantages and pitfalls in terms of its ability to achieve various biological goals, including cell-type classification, regulatory network modelling and biological process inference.

Human kidney organoids are an invaluable tool for studying kidney disease and injury, developing cell-based therapies, and testing new therapeutics. For such applications, large numbers of uniform organoids and highly reproducible assays are needed. We have built upon our previously published kidney organoid protocol to improve the overall health of the organoids. This simple, robust 3D protocol involves the formation of uniform embryoid bodies in minimum component medium containing lipids, insulin-transferrin-selenium-ethanolamine supplement and polyvinyl alcohol with GSK3 inhibitor (CHIR99021) for 3 days, followed by culture in knock-out serum replacement (KOSR)-containing medium. In addition, agitating assays allows for reduction in clumping of the embryoid bodies and maintaining a uniform size, which is important for reducing variability between organoids. Overall, the protocol provides a fast, efficient, and cost-effective method for generating large quantities of kidney organoids.},

	abstract = {Mouse models of Spina bifida (SB) have been instrumental for identifying genes, developmental processes, and environmental factors that influence neurulation and neural tube closure. Beyond the prominent neural tube defects, other aspects of the nervous system can be affected in SB with significant changes in essential bodily functions such as urination. SB patients frequently experience bladder dysfunction and SB fetuses exhibit reduced density of bladder nerves and smooth muscle although the developmental origins of these deficits have not been determined. The Pax3 Splotch-delayed (Pax3Sp-d) mouse model of SB is one of a very few mouse SB models that survives to late stages of gestation. Through analysis of Pax3Sp-d mutants we sought to define how altered bladder innervation in SB might arise by tracing sacral neural crest (NC) development, pelvic ganglia neuronal differentiation, and assessing bladder nerve fiber density. In Pax3Sp-d/Sp-d fetal mice we observed delayed migration of Sox10+ NC-derived progenitors (NCPs), deficient pelvic ganglia neurogenesis, and reduced density of bladder wall innervation. We further combined NC-specific deletion of Pax3 with the constitutive Pax3Sp-d allele in an effort to generate viable Pax3 mutants to examine later stages of bladder innervation and postnatal bladder function. Neural crest specific deletion of a Pax3 flox allele, using a Sox10-cre driver, in combination with a constitutive Pax3Sp-d mutation produced postnatal viable offspring that exhibited altered bladder function as well as reduced bladder wall innervation and altered connectivity between accessory ganglia at the bladder neck. Combined, the results show that Pax3 plays critical roles within sacral NC that are essential for initiation of neurogenesis and differentiation of autonomic neurons within pelvic ganglia.},

	abstract = {The primary function of the urinary bladder is to store urine (continence) until a suitable time for voiding (micturition). These distinct processes are determined by the coordinated activation of sensory and motor components of the nervous system, which matures to enable voluntary control at the time of weaning. Our aim was to define the development and maturation of the nerve-organ interface of the mouse urinary bladder by mapping the organ and tissue distribution of major classes of autonomic (motor) and sensory axons. Innervation of the bladder was evident from E13 and progressed dorsoventrally. Increasing defasciculation of axon bundles to single axons within the muscle occurred through the prenatal period, and in several classes of axons underwent further maturation until P7. Urothelial innervation occurred more slowly than muscle innervation and showed a clear regional difference, from E18 the bladder neck having the highest density of urothelial nerves. These features of innervation were similar in males and females but varied in timing and tissue density between different axon classes. We also analysed the pelvic ganglion, the major source of motor axons that innervate the lower urinary tract and other pelvic organs. Cholinergic, nitrergic (subset of cholinergic) and noradrenergic neuronal cell bodies were present prior to visualization of these axon classes within the bladder. Examination of cholinergic structures within the pelvic ganglion indicated that connections from spinal preganglionic neurons to pelvic ganglion neurons were already present by E12, a time at which these autonomic ganglion neurons had not yet innervated the bladder. These putative preganglionic inputs increased in density prior to birth as axon terminal fields continued to expand within the bladder tissues. Our studies also revealed in numerous pelvic ganglion neurons an unexpected transient expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide, a peptide commonly used to visualise the peptidergic class of visceral sensory axons. Together, our outcomes enhance our understanding of neural regulatory elements in the lower urinary tract during development and provide a foundation for studies of plasticity and regenerative capacity in the adult system.},

Our aim was to define transcripts specifically expressed by sacral visceral sensory neurons, as a step towards understanding the unique biology of these neurons and potentially leading to identification of new analgesic targets for pelvic visceral pain. Our strategy was to identify genes differentially expressed between sacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG) that include somatic neurons and sacral visceral neurons, and adjacent lumbar DRG that comprise exclusively of somatic sensory neurons. This was performed in adult and E18.5 male and female mice. By developing a method to restrict analyses to nociceptive Trpv1 neurons, a larger group of genes were detected as differentially expressed between spinal levels. We identified many novel genes that had not previously been associated with pelvic visceral sensation or nociception. Limited sex differences were detected across the transcriptome of sensory ganglia, but more were revealed in sacral levels and especially in Trpv1 nociceptive neurons. These data will facilitate development of new tools to modify mature and developing sensory neurons and nociceptive pathways.},

	abstract = {Abstract Diversity of neural crest derivatives has been studied with a variety of approaches during embryonic development. In mammals Cre-LoxP lineage tracing is a robust means to fate map neural crest relying on cre driven from regulatory elements of early neural crest genes. Sox10 is an essential transcription factor for normal neural crest development. A variety of efforts have been made to label neural crest derivatives using partial Sox10 regulatory elements to drive cre expression. To date published Sox10-cre lines have focused primarily on lineage tracing in specific tissues or during early fetal development. We describe two new Sox10-cre BAC transgenes, constitutive (cre) and inducible (cre/ERT2), that contain the complete repertoire of Sox10 regulatory elements. We present a thorough expression profile of each, identifying a few novel sites of Sox10 expression not captured by other neural crest cre drivers. Comparative mapping of expression patterns between the Sox10-cre and Sox10-cre/ERT2 transgenes identified a narrow temporal window in which Sox10 expression is present in mesenchymal derivatives prior to becoming restricted to neural elements during embryogenesis. In more caudal structures, such as the intestine and lower urinary tract, our Sox10-cre BAC transgene appears to be more efficient in labeling neural crest-derived cell types than Wnt1-cre. The analysis reveals consistent expression of Sox10 in non-neural crest derived glandular epithelium, including salivary, mammary, and urethral glands of adult mice. These Sox10-cre and Sox10-cre/ERT2 transgenic lines are verified tools that will enable refined temporal and cell-type specific lineage analysis of neural crest derivatives as well as glandular tissues that rely on Sox10 for proper development and function.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Castration-insensitive epithelial progenitors capable of regenerating the prostate have been proposed to be concentrated in the proximal region based on  facultative assays. Functional characterization of prostate epithelial populations  isolated with individual cell surface markers has failed to provide a consensus on  the anatomical and transcriptional identity of proximal prostate progenitors.  METHODS: Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to obtain a complete transcriptomic  profile of all epithelial cells in the mouse prostate and urethra to objectively  identify cellular subtypes. Pan-transcriptomic comparison to human prostate cell  types identified a mouse equivalent of human urethral luminal cells, which highly  expressed putative prostate progenitor markers. Validation of the urethral luminal  cell cluster was performed using immunostaining and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Our  data reveal that previously identified facultative progenitors marked by Trop2,  Sca-1, KRT4, and PSCA are actually luminal epithelial cells of the urethra that  extend into the proximal region of the prostate, and are resistant to  castration-induced androgen deprivation. Mouse urethral luminal cells were  identified to be the equivalent of previously identified human club and hillock  cells that similarly extend into proximal prostate ducts. Benign prostatic  hyperplasia (BPH) has long been considered an "embryonic reawakening," but the  cellular origin of the hyperplastic growth concentrated in the periurethral region  is unclear. We demonstrate an increase in urethral luminal cells within glandular  nodules from BPH patients. Urethral luminal cells are further increased in patients  treated with a 5-α reductase inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that cells  of the proximal prostate that express putative progenitor markers, and are enriched  by castration in the proximal prostate, are urethral luminal cells and that these  cells may play an important role in the etiology of human BPH.},

There has been a long-held belief that interactions between the progenitors of the collecting ducts and nephrons are primarily responsible for development of this organ. However, over the last several years, it has become increasingly clear that multiple aspects of kidney development require signaling from the interstitium. How the interstitium orchestrates these various roles is still poorly understood. We show that during development, the interstitium is a highly heterogeneous, patterned population of cells that occupies distinct positions correlated to the adjacent parenchyma. Our analysis indicates that the heterogeneity is not a mere reflection of different stages in a linear developmental trajectory but instead represents several novel differentiated cell states. Further, we find that beta-catenin has a cell autonomous role in the development of a medullary subset of the interstitium and that this non-autonomously affects the development of the adjacent epithelia. These findings suggest the intriguing possibility that the different interstitial subtypes may create microenvironments that play unique roles in development of the adjacent epithelia and endothelia.Graphical Abstract The developing interstitium is a highly heterogeneous, patterned population of cells that occupies distinct positions correlated to the adjacent parenchyma.},

Asynchronous mixing promoted nephrogenesis, and heterochronic organoids  were well vascularized when engrafted under the kidney capsule.

Proximal  tubule glucose uptake was confirmed, but despite these promising measures of graft  function, overgrowth of stromal cells prevented long-term study. We propose that  this is a technical feature of the engraftment procedure rather than a specific  shortcoming of the directed differentiation because kidney organoids derived from  primary cells and whole embryonic kidneys develop similar stromal overgrowth when  engrafted under the kidney capsule.},

Perturbations in luminal flow rate alter hydrodynamic forces to which these  cells in the cylindrical tubules are exposed. However, most studies of tubular ion  transport have been performed in cell monolayers grown on or epithelial sheets  affixed to a flat support, since analysis of transepithelial transport in native  tubules by in vitro microperfusion requires considerable expertise.

	abstract = {We have developed a novel chemical sensing technique termed high asymmetric longitudinal field ion mobility spectrometry (HALF-IMS), which allows separation of ions based on mobility differences in high and low electric fields. Our device is microfabricated, has a miniature format, and uses exceptionally low power due to the lack of RF separation fields normally associated with ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) or differential mobility spectrometry (DMS). It operates at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. This HALF-IMS chip contains a microscale drift cell where spatially varying electric field regions of high and low strengths are generated by direct current (DC) applied to the electrodes that are physically placed to cause ionic separation as the ionized chemical flows along the drift cell. Power and complexity are reduced at the chip and system levels by reducing the voltage magnitude and using DC-powered electronics. A testing platform utilizing an ultraviolet (UV) photoionization source was used with custom electronic circuit boards to interface with the chip and provide data inputs and outputs. Precise control of the electrode voltages allowed filtering of the passage of the ion of interest through the drift cell, and ionic current was measured at the detector. The device was tested by scanning of electrode voltages and obtaining ion peaks for methyl salicylate, naphthalene, benzene, and 2-butanone. The current experimental setup was capable of detecting as low as ∼80 ppb of methyl salicylate and naphthalene. The use of benzene as a dopant with 2-butanone allowed one to see two ion peaks, corresponding to benzene and 2-butanone.},

	abstract = {Air pollution can cause acute and chronic health problems. It has many components, and one component of interest is volatile organic compounds (VOCs). While the outdoor environment may have regulations regarding exposure limits, the indoor environment is often unregulated and VOCs often appear in greater concentrations in the indoor environment. Therefore, it is equally critical to monitor both the indoor and outdoor environments for ambient chemical levels that an individual person is exposed to. While a number of different chemical detectors exist, most lack the ability to provide portable monitoring. We have developed a portable and wearable sampler that collects environmental VOCs in a person’s immediate “exposure envelope” onto custom micro-preconcentrator chips for later benchtop analysis. The system also records ambient temperature and humidity and the GPS location during sampling, and the chip cartridges can be used in sequence over time to complete a profile of individual chemical exposure over the course of hours/days/weeks/months. The system can be programmed to accumulate sample for various times with varying periodicity. We first tested our sampler in the laboratory by completing calibration curves and testing saturation times for various common chemicals. The sampler was also tested in the field by collecting both indoor and outdoor personal exposure samples. Additionally under IRB approval, a teenaged volunteer wore the sampler for 5 days during which it sampled periodically throughout a 12 h period each day and the volunteer replaced the micro-preconcentrator chip each day.},

The best understood  asthma inflammatory pathways involve signals characterized by peripheral eosinophilia and elevated immunoglobulin E levels (called T2-high or allergic asthma), though other asthma phenotypes exist (eg, T2-low or non-allergic asthma, eosinophilic or neutrophilic-predominant). Common triggers that lead to poor asthma control and exacerbations include respiratory viruses, aeroallergens, house dust, molds, and other organic and inorganic substances. Increasingly recognized non-allergen triggers include tobacco smoke, small particulate matter  (eg, PM2.5), and volatile organic compounds. The interaction between respiratory  viruses and non-allergen asthma triggers is not well understood, though it is likely a connection exists which may lead to asthma development and/or exacerbations. In this paper we describe common respiratory viruses and non-allergen triggers associated with asthma. In addition, we aim to show the possible interactions, and potential synergy, between viruses and non-allergen triggers. Finally, we introduce a new clinical approach that collects exhaled breath condensates to identify metabolomics associated with viruses and non-allergen triggers that may promote the early management of asthma symptoms.},

	abstract = {The respiratory system is continuously exposed to variety of biological and chemical irritants that contain reactive oxygen species, and these are well known to cause oxidative stress responses in lung epithelial cells. There is a clinical need to identify biomarkers of oxidative stress which could potentially support early indicators of disease and health management. To identify volatile biomarkers of oxidative stress, we analyzed the headspace above human bronchial epithelial cell cultures (HBE1) before and after hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and cigarette smoke extract (CSE) exposure. Using stir bar and headspace sorptive extraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, we searched for volatile organic compounds (VOC) of these oxidative measures. In the H2O2 cell peroxidation experiments, four different H2O2 concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 10, 50 mM) were applied to the HBE1 cells, and VOCs were collected every 12 h over the time course of 48 h. In the CSE cell peroxidation experiments, four different smoke extract concentrations (0\%, 10\%, 30\%, 60\%) were applied to the cells, and VOCs were collected every 12 h over the time course of 48 h. We used partial-least squares (PLS) analysis to identify putative compounds from the mass spectrometry  results that highly correlated with the known applied oxidative stress. We observed chemical emissions from the cells that related to both the intensity of  the oxidative stress and followed distinct time courses. Additionally, some of these chemicals are aldehydes, which are thought to be non-invasive indicators of oxidative stress in exhaled human breath. Together, these results illustrate a powerful in situ cell culture model of oxidative stress that can be used to explore the putative biological genesis of exhaled breath biomarkers that are often observed in human clinical studies.},

Mobile spirometers are available commercially, and are used to monitor patients with advanced lung disease. However, these commercial monitors have a fixed product architecture determined by the manufacturer, and researchers cannot easily experiment with new configurations or add additional novel sensors over time. Spirometry combined with exhaled breath metabolite monitoring has the potential to transform healthcare and improve clinical management strategies. This research provides an updated design and benchmark testing for a flexible, portable, open access architecture to measure lung function, using common Arduino/Android microcontroller technologies. To demonstrate the feasibility and the proof-of-concept of this easily-adaptable platform technology, we had 43 subjects (healthy, and those with lung diseases) perform three spirometry maneuvers using our reconfigurable device and an office-based commercial spirometer. We found that our system compared favorably with the traditional spirometer, with high accuracy and agreement for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), and gas measurements were feasible. This provides an adaptable/reconfigurable open access \&ldquo;personalized medicine\&rdquo; platform for researchers and patients, and new chemical sensors and other modular instrumentation can extend the flexibility of the device in the future.},

	abstract = {Anal sacs are an important odor producing organ found across the mammalian Order Carnivora. Secretions from the anal sac may be used as chemical signals by animals for behaviors ranging from defense to species recognition to signaling reproductive status. In addition, a recent study suggests that domestic cats utilize short-chain free fatty acids in anal sac secretions for individual recognition. The fermentation hypothesis is the idea that symbiotic microorganisms living in association with animals contribute to odor profiles used in chemical communication and that variation in these chemical signals reflects variation in the microbial community. Here we examine the fermentation hypothesis by characterizing volatile organic compounds (VOC) and bacteria isolated from anal sac secretions collected from a male bengal cat, a cross between a domestic cat and wild leopard cat (Felis catus × Prionailurus bengalensis).Both left and right anal sacs of a male bengal cat were manually expressed (emptied) and collected. Half of the material was used to culture bacteria or to extract bacterial DNA and other half was used for VOC analysis. DNA was extracted from the anal sac secretions and used for a 16S rRNA gene sequence based characterization of the microbial community. Additionally, some of the material was plated out in order to isolate bacterial colonies. The same three taxa, Bacteroides fragilis, Tessaracoccus, and Finegoldia magna were abundant in the 16S rRNA gene sequence data and also isolated by culturing. Using Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we tentatively identified 52 compounds from bengal cat anal sac secretions and 67 compounds from cultures of the three bacterial isolates chosen for further analysis.. Among 67 compounds tentatively identified from bacteria isolates, 52 were also found in the anal sac secretion.We show that the bacterial community in the anal sac consists primarily of only a few abundant taxa and that isolates of these taxa produce numerous volatiles that are found in the combined anal sac volatile profile. Many of these volatiles are found in anal sac secretions from other carnivorans, and are also associated with known bacterial biosynthesis pathways. This supports the fermentation hypothesis and the idea that the anal sac is maintained at least in part to house bacteria that produce volatiles for the host.},

There is little information regarding drugs and their metabolites contained in breath, as well as their pharmacokinetics. In this present work, we use a simple and non-invasive technique to collect EBC from chronic pain patients using different analgesic opioid drugs to manage pain. Six patients received continuous infusion of morphine and hydromorphone intravenously (IV), together with other analgesic drugs (IV and orally). Repeated sampling of serum and EBC was done at two time points separated by 90 min. The EBC was collected using a glass tube surrounded by dry ice, and an ethanol solvent wash of the glass was performed after EBC extraction to retrieve the apolar compounds stuck to the glass surface. All samples were analyzed with liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify possible metabolites present in the sample, and to quantify the drugs being used. Several metabolites, such as normorphine (norM), norhydromorphone (norHM) and dihydromorphone (diHM) were detected in both fractions, while hydromorphone 3-glucuronide (HM 3G) was only detected in the solvent rinse fraction. Results were correlated to explain the pharmacokinetics of the main drugs administered. This pilot study presented promising correlations between drug concentrations in blood and breath at different time points for norM, norHM and HM 3G.},

These devices separate chemical compounds in a mixture and provide information to identify specific chemical species of interest. Further, these types of devices operate well in both controlled lab environments and in-field applications. Frequently, the commercial versions of these devices are highly tailored for niche applications (e.g., explosives detection) because of the difficulty involved in reconfiguring instrumentation hardware and data analysis software algorithms. In order for researchers to quickly adapt these tools for new purposes and broader panels of chemical targets, it is critical to develop new algorithms and methods for generating libraries of these sensor responses. Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology has been used to fabricate DMS devices that miniaturize the platforms for easier deployment; however, concurrent advances in advanced data analytics are lagging. DMS generates complex three-dimensional dispersion plots for both positive and negative ions in a mixture. Although simple spectra of single chemicals are straightforward to interpret (both visually and via algorithms), it is exceedingly challenging to interpret dispersion plots from complex mixtures with many chemical constituents. This study uses image processing and computer vision steps to automatically identify features from DMS dispersion plots. We used the bag-of-words approach adapted from natural language processing and information retrieval to cluster and organize these features. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm was trained using these features in order to detect and classify specific compounds in these represented conceptualized data outputs. Using this approach, we successfully maintain a high level of correct chemical identification, even when a gas mixture increases in complexity with interfering chemicals present.},

	abstract = {Volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions were measured from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell and T cell bioreactor gas exhaust lines with the goal of non-invasively metabolically profiling the expansion process. Measurements of cellular ‘breath’ were made directly from the gas exhaust lines using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-coated magnetic stir bars, which underwent subsequent thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD–GC–MS) analysis. Baseline VOC profiles were observed from bioreactors filled with only liquid media. After inoculation, unique VOC profiles correlated to cell expansion over the course of 8 d. Partial least squares (PLS) regression models were built to predict cell culture density based on VOC profiles of CHO and T cells (R 2 = 0.671 and R 2 = 0.769, respectively, based on a validation data set). T cell runs resulted in 47 compounds relevant to expansion while CHO cell runs resulted in 45 compounds; the 20 most relevant compounds of each cell type were putatively identified. On the final experimental days, sorbent-covered stir bars were placed directly into cell-inoculated media and into media controls. Liquid-based measurements from spent media containing cells could be distinguished from media-only controls, indicating soluble VOCs excreted by the cells during expansion. A PLS-discriminate analysis (PLS–DA) was performed, and 96 compounds differed between T cell-inoculated media and media controls with 72 compounds for CHO cells; the 20 most relevant compounds of each cell line were putatively identified. This work demonstrates that the volatilome of cell cultures can be exploited by chemical detectors in bioreactor gas and liquid waste lines to non-invasively monitor cellular health and could possibly be used to optimize cell expansion conditions ‘on-the-fly’ with appropriate control loop systems. Although the basis for statistical models included compounds without certain identification, this work provides a foundation for future research of bioreactor emissions. Future studies must move towards identifying relevant compounds for understanding of underlying biochemistry.},

            The ability to controllably perfuse kidney organoids would better recapitulate the native tissue microenvironment for applications ranging from drug testing to therapeutic use. Here, we report a perfusable, vascularized kidney organoid on chip model composed of two individually addressable channels embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM). The channels are respectively seeded with kidney organoids and human umbilical vein endothelial cells that form a confluent endothelium (macrovessel). During perfusion, endogenous endothelial cells present within the kidney organoids migrate through the ECM towards the macrovessel, where they form lumen-on-lumen anastomoses that are supported by stromal-like cells. Once micro-macrovessel integration is achieved, we introduced fluorescently labeled dextran of varying molecular weight and red blood cells into the macrovessel, which are transported through the microvascular network to the glomerular epithelia within the kidney organoids. Our approach for achieving controlled organoid perfusion opens new avenues for generating other perfused human tissues.},

Kidney organoids, with their ability to replicate complex renal structures, provide a novel platform for investigating kidney diseases and assessing drug efficacy, albeit hindered by labor-intensive generation and batch variations, highlighting the need for tailored cryopreservation methods to enable widespread utilization. Here, we evaluated cryopreservation strategies for kidney organoids by contrasting slow-freezing and vitrification methods. 118 kidney organoids were categorized into five conditions. Control organoids followed standard culture, while two slow-freezing groups used 10\% DMSO (SF1) or commercial freezing media (SF2). Vitrification involved V1 (20\% DMSO, 20\% Ethylene Glycol with sucrose) and V2 (15\% DMSO, 15\% Ethylene Glycol). Assessment of viability, functionality, and structural integrity post-thawing revealed notable differences. Vitrification, particularly V1, exhibited superior viability (91\% for V1, 26\% for V2, 79\% for SF1, and 83\% for SF2 compared to 99.4\% in controls). 3D imaging highlighted distinct nephron segments among groups, emphasizing V1’s efficacy in preserving both podocytes and tubules in kidney organoids. Cisplatin-induced injury revealed a significant reduction in regenerative capacities in organoids cryopreserved by flow-freezing methods, while the V1 method did not show statistical significance compared to the unfrozen controls. This study underscores vitrification, especially with high concentrations of cryoprotectants, as an effective approach for maintaining kidney organoid viability and structure during cryopreservation, offering practical approaches for kidney organoid research.},

              High-throughput drug screening is crucial for advancing healthcare through drug discovery. However, a significant limitation arises from available
              in vitro
              models using conventional 2D cell culture, which lack the proper phenotypes and architectures observed in three-dimensional (3D) tissues. Recent advancements in stem cell biology have facilitated the generation of organoids—3D tissue constructs that mimic human organs
              in vitro
              . Kidney organoids, derived from human pluripotent stem cells, represent a significant breakthrough in disease representation. They encompass major kidney cell types organized within distinct nephron segments, surrounded by stroma and endothelial cells. This tissue allows for the assessment of structural alterations such as nephron loss, a characteristic of chronic kidney disease. Despite these advantages, the complexity of 3D structures has hindered the use of organoids for large-scale drug screening, and the drug screening pipelines utilizing these complex
              in vitro
              models remain to be established for high-throughput screening. In this study, we address the technical limitations of kidney organoids through fully automated 3D imaging, aided by a machine-learning approach for automatic profiling of nephron segment-specific epithelial morphometry. Kidney organoids were exposed to the nephrotoxic agent cisplatin to model severe acute kidney injury. An U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug library was tested for therapeutic and nephrotoxicity screening. The fully automated pipeline of 3D image acquisition and analysis identified nephrotoxic or therapeutic drugs during cisplatin chemotherapy. The nephrotoxic potential of these drugs aligned with previous
              in vivo
              and human reports. Additionally, Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in hematological malignancies, was identified as a potential preventive therapy for cisplatin-induced kidney injury. Our proof-of-concept report demonstrates that the automated screening process, using 3D morphometric assays with kidney organoids, enables high-throughput screening for nephrotoxicity and therapeutic assessment in 3D tissue constructs.},

While these approaches have great potential, the literature has shown that ML-based approaches frequently suffer from results that are either incorrect or unreproducible due to mismanagement or misuse of data used for training and validating the models [12, 15]. Recognition of the necessity of high-quality data for correct ML results has led to data-centric ML approaches that shift the central focus from model development to creation of high-quality data sets to train and validate the models [14, 20]. However, there are limited tools and methods available for data-centric approaches to explore and evaluate ML solutions for eScience problems which often require collaborative multidisciplinary teams working with models and data that will rapidly evolve as an investigation unfolds [1]. In this paper, we show how data management tools based on the principle that all of the data for ML should be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (i.e. FAIR [26]) can significantly improve the quality of data that is used for ML applications. When combined with best practices that apply these tools to the entire life cycle of an ML-based eScience investigation, we can significantly improve the ability of an eScience team to create correct and reproducible ML solutions. We propose an architecture and implementation of such tools and demonstrate through two use cases how they can be used to improve ML-based eScience investigations.},

              Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a progressive expansion of peri‐urethral prostate tissue common in aging men. Patients with enlarged prostates are treated with 5‐alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) to shrink prostate volume by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). A reduction in DHT levels can elicit atrophy and apoptosis of prostate secretory luminal cells, which results in a favorable clinical response characterized by improved lower urinary tract symptoms. However, the histologic response to 5ARI treatment is often heterogeneous across prostate acini and lower urinary tract symptoms can persist to require surgical intervention. We used two spatial profiling approaches to characterize gene expression changes across histologically normal and atrophied regions in prostates from 5ARI‐treated men. Objective transcriptomic profiling using the Visium spatial gene expression platform showed that 5ARI‐induced atrophy of prostate luminal cells correlated with reduced androgen receptor signaling and increased expression of urethral club cell genes including
              LTF
              ,
              PIGR

              , and
              SCGB3A1
              . Prostate luminal cells within atrophied acini adapted to decreased DHT conditions by increasing NF‐κB signaling and anti‐apoptotic
              BCL2
              expression, which may explain their survival. Using GeoMx digital spatial profiling with a probe set to assess {\textasciitilde}18 000 RNA targets, we confirmed that atrophied acini expressing
              SCGB3A1
              displayed higher levels of club cell markers compared with histologically normal acini with
              NKX3‐1
              expression. In addition, club‐like cells within regions of 5ARI‐induced atrophy closely resembled true club cells from the prostatic urethra. A comparison of histologically normal regions from 5ARI‐treated men and histologically normal regions from untreated men revealed few transcriptional differences. Taken together, our results describe a heterogeneous response to 5ARI treatment where cells in atrophied acini undergo an adaptation from a prostate secretory luminal to a club cell‐like state in response to 5ARI treatment. © 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.},

In addition to learned and cultural factors, genetics is hypothesized to contribute to DFA. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants contributing to DFA. Adult and adolescent participants were from 4 cohorts (3 from the US-based Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia, n = 1,144, 1,164, and 535, and the UK-based Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children [ALSPAC], n = 2,078). Two self-report instruments were used to assess DFA: the Dental Fear Survey (US cohorts) and Corah’s Dental Anxiety Scale (ALSPAC). Genome-wide scans were performed for the DFA total scores and subscale scores (avoidance, physiological arousal, fear of dental treatment–specific stimuli), adjusting for age, sex, educational attainment, recruitment site, and genetic ancestry. Results across cohorts were combined using meta-analysis. Heritability estimates for DFA total and subscale scores were similar across cohorts and ranged from 23\% to 59\%. The meta-analysis revealed 3 significant ( P {\textless} 5E-8) associations between genetic loci and 2 DFA subscales: physiological arousal and avoidance. Nearby genes included NTSR1 ( P = 3.05E-8), DMRTA1 ( P = 4.40E-8), and FAM84A ( P = 7.72E-9). Of these, NTSR1, which was associated with the avoidance subscale, mediates neurotensin function, and its deficiency may lead to altered fear memory in mice. Gene enrichment analyses indicated that loci associated with the DFA total score and physiological arousal subscale score were enriched for genes associated with severe and persistent mental health (e.g., schizophrenia) and neurocognitive (e.g., autism) disorders. Heritability analysis indicated that DFA is partly explained by genetic factors, and our association results suggested shared genetic underpinnings with other psychological conditions.},

	abstract = {Genetic risk factors play important roles in the etiology of oral, dental, and craniofacial diseases. Identifying the relevant risk loci and understanding their molecular biology could highlight new prevention and management avenues. Our current understanding of oral health genomics suggests that dental caries and periodontitis are polygenic diseases, and very large sample sizes and informative phenotypic measures are required to discover signals and adequately map associations across the human genome. In this article, we introduce the second wave of the Gene-Lifestyle Interactions and Dental Endpoints consortium (GLIDE2) and discuss relevant data analytics challenges, opportunities, and applications. In this phase, the consortium comprises a diverse, multiethnic sample of over 700,000 participants from 21 studies contributing clinical data on dental caries experience and periodontitis. We outline the methodological challenges of combining data from heterogeneous populations, as well as the data reduction problem in resolving detailed clinical examination records into tractable phenotypes, and describe a strategy that addresses this. Specifically, we propose a 3-tiered phenotyping approach aimed at leveraging both the large sample size in the consortium and the detailed clinical information available in some studies, wherein binary, severity-encompassing, and “precision,” data-driven clinical traits are employed. As an illustration of the use of data-driven traits across multiple cohorts, we present an application of dental caries experience data harmonization in 8 participating studies ( N = 55,143) using previously developed permanent dentition tooth surface–level dental caries pattern traits. We demonstrate that these clinical patterns are transferable across multiple cohorts, have similar relative contributions within each study, and thus are prime targets for genetic interrogation in the expanded and diverse multiethnic sample of GLIDE2. We anticipate that results from GLIDE2 will decisively advance the knowledge base of mechanisms at play in oral, dental, and craniofacial health and disease and further catalyze international collaboration and data and resource sharing in genomics research.},

This defect is caused by environmental and/or genetic factors that interfere with tooth formation, emphasizing the importance of investigating enamel hypoplasia on an epidemiological and genetic level.   \textbf{\textit{Methods:}}  A genome-wide association of enamel hypoplasia was performed in multiple cohorts, overall comprising 7,159 individuals ranging in age from 7 to 82 years. Mixed models were used to test for genetic association while simultaneously accounting for relatedness and genetic population structure. Meta-analysis was then performed. More than 5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms were tested in individual cohorts.   \textbf{\textit{Results:}}  Analyses of the individual cohorts and meta-analysis identified association signals close to genome-wide significance (\textit{p} \&\#x3c; 5 × 10$^{\textrm{–8}}$), and many suggestive association signals (5 × 10$^{\textrm{–8}}$ \&\#x3c; \textit{p \&\#x3c;} 5 × 10$^{\textrm{–6}}$) near genes with plausible roles in tooth/enamel development.   \textbf{\textit{Conclusion:}}  The strongest association signal (\textit{p} = 1.57 × 10$^{\textrm{–9}}$) was observed near \textit{BMP2K} in one of the individual cohorts. Additional suggestive signals were observed near genes with plausible roles in tooth development in the meta-analysis, such as \textit{SLC4A4} which can influence enamel hypoplasia. Additional human genetic studies are needed to replicate these results and functional studies in model systems are needed to validate our findings.},

Using unbiased single-cell RNA-seq analysis followed by in situ analysis of gene expression profiles, we show that Shh and Bmp4 signaling pathways are activated in a complementary pattern along the oral-aboral axis in mouse embryonic mandibular arch. Tissue-specific inactivation of hedgehog signaling in neural crest-derived mandibular mesenchyme led to expansion of BMP signaling activity to throughout the oral-aboral axis of the distal mandibular arch and subsequently duplication of dentary bone in the oral side of the mandible at the expense of tongue formation.

              Background
              Cleft palate is one of the most prevalent birth defects. Mice are useful for studying palate development because of their morphological and genetic similarities to humans. In mice, palate development occurs between embryonic days (E)11.5 to 15.5. Single cell transcriptional profiles of palate cell populations have been a valuable resource for the craniofacial research community, but we lack a single cell transcriptional profile for anterior palate at E13.5, at the transition from proliferation to shelf elevation.
            
            
              Results
              A detailed single cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals heterogeneity in expression profiles of the cell populations of the E13.5 anterior palate. Hybridization chain reaction RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (HCR RNA FISH) reveals epithelial populations segregate into layers. Mesenchymal populations spatially segregate into four domains. One of these mesenchymal populations expresses ligands and receptors distinct from the rest of the mesenchyme, suggesting that these cells have a unique function. RNA velocity analysis shows two terminal cell states that contribute to either the proximal or distal palatal regions emerge from a single progenitor pool.
            
            
              Conclusion
              This single cell resolution expression data and detailed analysis from E13.5 anterior palate provides a powerful resource for mechanistic insight into secondary palate morphogenesis for the craniofacial research community.

              Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reside in microenvironments, referred to as niches, which provide structural support and molecular signals. Sensory nerves are niche components in the homeostasis of tissues such as skin, bone marrow and hematopoietic system. However, how the sensory nerve affects the behavior of MSCs remains largely unknown. Here we show that the sensory nerve is vital for mesenchymal tissue homeostasis and maintenance of MSCs in the continuously growing adult mouse incisor. Loss of sensory innervation leads to mesenchymal disorder and a decrease in MSCs. Mechanistically, FGF1 from the sensory nerve directly acts on MSCs by binding to FGFR1 and activates the mTOR/autophagy axis to sustain MSCs. Modulation of mTOR/autophagy restores the MSCs and rescues the mesenchymal tissue disorder of

            Craniofacial morphogenesis requires complex interactions involving different tissues, signaling pathways, secreted factors and organelles. The details of these interactions remain elusive. In this study, we have analyzed the molecular mechanisms and homeostatic cellular activities governing soft palate development to improve regenerative strategies for individuals with cleft palate. We have identified canonical Wnt signaling as a key signaling pathway primarily active in cranial neural crest (CNC)-derived mesenchymal cells surrounding soft palatal myogenic cells. Using Osr2-Cre;β-cateninfl/fl mice, we show that Wnt signaling is indispensable for mesenchymal cell proliferation and subsequently for myogenesis through mediating ciliogenesis. Specifically, we have identified that Wnt signaling directly regulates expression of the ciliary gene Ttll3. Impaired ciliary disassembly leads to differentiation defects in mesenchymal cells and indirectly disrupts myogenesis through decreased expression of Dlk1, a mesenchymal cell-derived pro-myogenesis factor. Moreover, we show that siRNA-mediated reduction of Ttll3 expression partly rescues mesenchymal cell proliferation and myogenesis in the palatal explant cultures from Osr2-Cre;β-cateninfl/fl embryos. This study highlights the role of Wnt signaling in palatogenesis through the control of ciliary homeostasis, which establishes a new mechanism for Wnt-regulated craniofacial morphogenesis.},

During late embryonic development in mice, myogenic progenitors migrate to discrete sites to form individual muscles. The detailed mechanism of this process remains unclear. Using mouse levator veli palatini (LVP) development as a model, we systematically investigated how a distinct connective tissue subpopulation, perimysial fibroblasts, communicates with myogenic cells to regulate mouse pharyngeal myogenesis. Using single-cell RNAseq data analysis, we identified that TGF-β signaling is a key regulator for the perimysial fibroblasts.

	abstract = {High incidence of chronic otitis media is associated with human craniofacial syndromes, suggesting that defects in the formation of the middle ear and associated structures can have a knock-on effect on the susceptibility to middle ear inflammation. Patients with branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome have several defects in the ear leading to both sensorineural and conductive hearing loss, including otitis media. 40\% of BOR syndrome cases are due to
              Eya1
              haploinsufficiency, with mouse models affecting
              Eya1
              , mimicking many of the defects found in patients. Here, we characterize the onset, consequences, and underlying causes of chronic otitis media in
              Eya1
              heterozygous mice. Cavitation defects were evident in these mice from postnatal day (P)11 onwards, with mesenchyme around the promontory and attic regions of the middle ear space. This mesenchyme was still prominent in adult
              Eya1
              heterozygous mice, while the wild-type littermates had fully aerated ears from P14 onwards. MicroCT analysis highlighted a significantly smaller bulla, confirming the link between bulla size defects and the ability of the mesenchyme to retract successfully. Otitis media was observed from P14, often presenting unilaterally, resulting in hyperplasia of the middle ear mucosa, expansion of secretory cells, defects in the motile cilia, and changes in basal epithelial cell markers. A high incidence of otitis media was identified in older mice but only associated with ears with retained mesenchyme. To understand the impact of the environment, the mouse line was rederived onto a super-clean environment. Cavitation defects were still evident at early stages, but these generally resolved over time, and importantly, no signs of otitis media were observed at 6 weeks. In conclusion, we show that a small bulla size is closely linked to defects in cavitation and the presence of retained mesenchyme. A delay in retraction of the mesenchyme predates the onset of otitis media, making the ears susceptible to its development. Early exposure to OM appears to exacerbate the cavitation defect, with mesenchyme evident in the middle ear throughout the animal’s life. This highlights that permanent damage to the middle ear can arise as a consequence of the early onset of OM.},
