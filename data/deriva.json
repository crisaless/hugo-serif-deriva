    "abstract": "Complex morphological traits are the product of many genes with transient or lasting developmental effects that interact in anatomical context. Mouse models are a key resource for disentangling such effects, because they offer myriad tools for manipulating the genome in a controlled environment. Unfortunately, phenotypic data are often obtained using laboratory-specific protocols, resulting in self-contained datasets that are difficult to relate to one another for larger scale analyses. To enable meta-analyses of morphological variation, particularly in the craniofacial complex and brain, we created MusMorph, a database of standardized mouse morphology data spanning numerous genotypes and developmental stages, including E10.5, E11.5, E14.5, E15.5, E18.5, and adulthood. To standardize data collection, we implemented an atlas-based phenotyping pipeline that combines techniques from image registration, deep learning, and morphometrics. Alongside stage-specific atlases, we provide aligned micro-computed tomography images, dense anatomical landmarks, and segmentations (if available) for each specimen (N\u2009=\u200910,056). Our workflow is open-source to encourage transparency and reproducible data collection. The MusMorph data and scripts are available on FaceBase (www.facebase.org, https://doi.org/10.25550/3-HXMC) and GitHub (https://github.com/jaydevine/MusMorph).",

The resources generated by the FaceBase projects include a number of dynamic imaging modalities, genome-wide association studies, software tools for analyzing human facial abnormalities, detailed phenotyping, anatomical and molecular atlases, global and specific gene expression patterns, and transcriptional profiling over the course of embryonic and postnatal development in animal models and humans. The integrated data visualization tools, faceted search infrastructure, and curation provided by the FaceBase Hub offer flexible and intuitive ways to interact with these multidisciplinary data. In parallel, the datasets also offer unique opportunities for new collaborations and training for researchers coming into the field of craniofacial studies. Here, we highlight the focus of each spoke project and the integration of datasets contributed by the spokes to facilitate craniofacial research.",

    "abstract": "(Re)Building a Kidney is a National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases-led consortium to optimize approaches for the isolation, expansion, and differentiation of appropriate kidney cell types and the integration of these cells into complex structures that replicate human kidney function. The ultimate goals of the consortium are two-fold: to develop and implement strategies for in vitro engineering of replacement kidney tissue, and to devise strategies to stimulate regeneration of nephrons in situ to restore failing kidney function. Projects within the consortium will answer fundamental questions regarding human gene expression in the developing kidney, essential signaling crosstalk between distinct cell types of the developing kidney, how to derive the many cell types of the kidney through directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells, which bioengineering or scaffolding strategies have the most potential for kidney tissue formation, and basic parameters of the regenerative response to injury. As these projects progress, the consortium will incorporate systematic investigations in physiologic function of in vitro and in vivo differentiated kidney tissue, strategies for engraftment in experimental animals, and development of therapeutic approaches to activate innate reparative responses.",

    "abstract": "Current approaches for ment have failed to keep pace with the needs of increasingly data-intensive science. The overhead and burden of managing data in complex discovery processes, involving experimental protocols with numerous data-producing and computational steps, has become the gating factor that determines the pace of discovery. The lack of comprehensive systems to capture, manage, organize and retrieve data throughout the discovery life cycle leads to significant overheads on scientists time and effort, reduced productivity, lack of reproducibility, and an absence of data sharing. In \u201ccreative fields\u201d like digital photography and music, digi- tal asset management (DAM) systems for capturing, managing, curating and consuming digital assets like photos and audio recordings, have fundamentally transformed how these data are used. While asset management has not taken hold in eScience applications, we believe that transformation similar to that observed in the creative space could be achieved in scientific domains if appropriate ecosystems of asset management tools existed, tools to capture, manage, and curate data throughout the scientific discovery process. We introduce a framework and infrastructure for asset management in eScience and present initial results from its usage in active research use cases.",

    "abstract": "Scientific discovery is increasingly dependent on a scientist\u2019s ability to acquire, curate, integrate, analyze, and share large and diverse collections of data. While the details vary from domain to domain, these data often consist of diverse digital assets (e.g. image files, sequence data, or simulation outputs) that are organized with complex relationships and context which may evolve over the course of an investigation. In addition, discovery is often collaborative, such that sharing of the data and its organizational context is highly desirable. Common systems for managing file or asset metadata hide their inherent relational structures, while traditional relational database systems do not extend to the distributed collaborative environment often seen in scientific investigations. To address these issues, we introduce ERMrest, a collaborative data management service which allows general entity-relationship modeling of metadata manipulated by RESTful access methods. We present the design criteria, architecture, and service implementation, as well as describe an ecosystem of tools and services that we have created to integrate metadata into an end-to-end scientific data life cycle. ERMrest has been deployed to hundreds of users across multiple scientific research communities and projects. We present two representative use cases: an international consortium and an early-phase, multidisciplinary research project.",

    "abstract": "The FaceBase Consortium, funded by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research of the National Institutes of Health, was established in 2009 with the recognition that dental and craniofacial research are increasingly data-intensive disciplines. Data sharing is critical for the validation and reproducibility of results as well as to enable reuse of data. In service of these goals, data ought to be FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The FaceBase data repository and educational resources exemplify the FAIR principles and support a broad user community including researchers in craniofacial development, molecular genetics, and genomics. FaceBase demonstrates that a model in which researchers \u201cself-curate\u201d their data can be successful and scalable. We present the results of the first 2.5 y of FaceBase\u2019s operations as an open community and summarize the data sets published during this period. We then describe a research highlight from work on the identification of regulatory networks and noncoding RNAs involved in cleft lip with/without cleft palate that both used and in turn contributed new findings to publicly available FaceBase resources. Collectively, FaceBase serves as a dynamic and continuously evolving resource to facilitate data-intensive research, enhance data reproducibility, and perform deep phenotyping across multiple species in dental and craniofacial research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cell biology is increasingly focused on cellular heterogeneity and multicellular systems. To make the fullest use of experimental, clinical, and computational efforts, we need standardized data formats, community-curated \u201cpublic data libraries\u201d, and tools to combine and analyze shared data. To address these needs, our multidisciplinary community created MultiCellDS (MultiCellular Data Standard): an extensible standard, a library of digital cell lines and tissue snapshots, and support software. With the help of experimentalists, clinicians, modelers, and data and library scientists, we can grow this seed into a community-owned ecosystem of shared data and tools, to the benefit of basic science, engineering, and human health.",

    "abstract": "Discovery of new knowledge is increasingly data-driven, predicated on a team\u2019s ability to collaboratively create, find, analyze, retrieve, and share pertinent datasets over the duration of an investigation. This is especially true in the domain of scientific discovery where generation, analysis, and interpretation of data are the fundamental mechanisms by which research teams collaborate to achieve their shared scientific goal. Data-driven discovery in general, and scientific discovery in particular, is distinguished by complex and diverse data models and formats that evolve over the lifetime of an investigation. While databases and related information systems have the potential to be valuable tools in the discovery process, developing effective interfaces for data-driven discovery remains a roadblock to the application of database technology as an essential tool in scientific investigations. In this paper, we present a model-adaptive approach to creating interaction environments for data-driven discovery of scientific data that automatically generates interactive user interfaces for editing, searching, and viewing scientific data based entirely on introspection of an extended relational data model. We have applied model-adaptive interface generation to many active scientific investigations spanning domains of proteomics, bioinformatics, neuroscience, occupational therapy, stem cells, genitourinary, craniofacial development, and others. We present the approach, its implementation, and its evaluation through analysis of its usage in diverse scientific settings.",

    "abstract": "The need to describe and exchange large and complex data underlies the vast majority of science conducted today. Such needs arise when downloading data from a repository, moving data between remote locations, exchanging data between collaborators, and even publishing data as part of the publication process. While such examples are common, it is surprisingly difficult to describe and exchange data, and it is even more difficult when datasets are large and span multiple storage locations. To address some of these challenges we proposed the Big Data Bag (BDBag) as a data packaging format for representing and describing complex, distributed, and large datasets. In this presentation, we outline the BDBag model and describe three scenarios in which it is currently being used",

    "abstract": "Comprehensive modeling of a whole cell requires an integration of vast amounts of information on various aspects of the cell and its parts. To divide and conquer this task, we introduce Bayesian metamodeling, a general approach to modeling complex systems by integrating a collection of heterogeneous input models. Each input model can in principle be based on any type of data and can describe a different aspect of the modeled system using any mathematical representation, scale, and level of granularity. These input models are 1) converted to a standardized statistical representation relying on probabilistic graphical models, 2) coupled by modeling their mutual relations with the physical world, and 3) finally harmonized with respect to each other. To illustrate Bayesian metamodeling, we provide a proof-of-principle metamodel of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by human pancreatic \u03b2-cells. The input models include a coarse-grained spatiotemporal simulation of insulin vesicle trafficking, docking, and exocytosis; a molecular network model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion signaling; a network model of insulin metabolism; a structural model of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor activation; a linear model of a pancreatic cell population; and ordinary differential equations for systemic postprandial insulin response. Metamodeling benefits from decentralized computing, while often producing a more accurate, precise, and complete model that contextualizes input models as well as resolves conflicting information. We anticipate Bayesian metamodeling will facilitate collaborative science by providing a framework for sharing expertise, resources, data, and models, as exemplified by the Pancreatic \u03b2-Cell Consortium.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The FaceBase Consortium was established by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research in 2009 as a \u201cbig data\u201d resource for the craniofacial research community. Over the past decade, researchers have deposited hundreds of annotated and curated datasets on both normal and disordered craniofacial development in FaceBase, all freely available to the research community on the FaceBase Hub website. The Hub has developed numerous visualization and analysis tools designed to promote integration of multidisciplinary data while remaining dedicated to the FAIR principles of data management (findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability) and providing a faceted search infrastructure for locating desired data efficiently. Summaries of the datasets generated by the FaceBase projects from 2014 to 2019 are provided here. FaceBase 3 now welcomes contributions of data on craniofacial and dental development in humans, model organisms and cell lines. Collectively, the FaceBase Consortium, along with other NIH-supported data resources, provide a continuously growing, dynamic and current resource for the scientific community while improving data reproducibility and fulfilling data sharing requirements.",

    "abstract": "The Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) has created a flexible system of data federation that enables researchers to discover datasets from across the US National Institutes of Health Common Fund without requiring that data owners move, reformat, or rehost those data. This system is centered on a catalog that integrates detailed descriptions of biomedical datasets from individual Common Fund Programs\u2019 Data Coordination Centers (DCCs) into a uniform metadata model that can then be indexed and searched from a centralized portal. This Crosscut Metadata Model (C2M2) supports the wide variety of data types and metadata terms used by individual DCCs and can readily describe nearly all forms of biomedical research data. We detail its use to ingest and index data from 11 DCCs.",

    "abstract": "Defining the structural and functional changes in the nervous system underlying learning and memory represents a major challenge for modern neuroscience. Although changes in neuronal activity following memory formation have been studied [B. F. Grewe et\u00a0al., Nature 543, 670\u2013675 (2017); M. T. Rogan, U. V. St\u00e4ubli, J. E. LeDoux, Nature 390, 604\u2013607 (1997)], the underlying structural changes at the synapse level remain poorly understood. Here, we capture synaptic changes in the midlarval zebrafish brain that occur during associative memory formation by imaging excitatory synapses labeled with recombinant probes using selective plane illumination microscopy. Imaging the same subjects before and after classical conditioning at single-synapse resolution provides an unbiased mapping of synaptic changes accompanying memory formation. In control animals and animals that failed to learn the task, there were no significant changes in the spatial patterns of synapses in the pallium, which contains the equivalent of the mammalian amygdala and is essential for associative learning in teleost fish [M. Portavella, J. P. Vargas, B. Torres, C. Salas, Brain Res. Bull . 57, 397\u2013399 (2002)]. In zebrafish that formed memories, we saw a dramatic increase in the number of synapses in the ventrolateral pallium, which contains neurons active during memory formation and retrieval. Concurrently, synapse loss predominated in the dorsomedial pallium. Surprisingly, we did not observe significant changes in the intensity of synaptic labeling, a proxy for synaptic strength, with memory formation in any region of the pallium. Our results suggest that memory formation due to classical conditioning is associated with reciprocal changes in synapse numbers in the pallium.",

    "abstract": "Increasingly, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are used in eScience applications [9]. While these approaches have great potential, the literature has shown that ML-based approaches frequently suffer from results that are either incorrect or unreproducible due to mismanagement or misuse of data used for training and validating the models [12, 15]. Recognition of the necessity of high-quality data for correct ML results has led to data-centric ML approaches that shift the central focus from model development to creation of high-quality data sets to train and validate the models [14, 20]. However, there are limited tools and methods available for data-centric approaches to explore and evaluate ML solutions for eScience problems which often require collaborative multidisciplinary teams working with models and data that will rapidly evolve as an investigation unfolds [1]. In this paper, we show how data management tools based on the principle that all of the data for ML should be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (i.e. FAIR [26]) can significantly improve the quality of data that is used for ML applications. When combined with best practices that apply these tools to the entire life cycle of an ML-based eScience investigation, we can significantly improve the ability of an eScience team to create correct and reproducible ML solutions. We propose an architecture and implementation of such tools and demonstrate through two use cases how they can be used to improve ML-based eScience investigations.",
